US Vice President Al Gore, for his part, opened the summit saying free   trade was compatible with sustainable development and saying that the   private sector was the key to success.   \"The private sector is and will remain the main engine of sustained   development,\" he said.   Gore had been expected to shake up the regional meeting with a   counter-proposal to the summit declaration drafted by diplomats, but   did not do so.   Gore, a strong advocate of the environment, was one of 28 government   leaders from the Americas meeting here to debate a draft document that   states development policies should have a human face.   \"The object and subject of development should be human ... The goal of   our efforts in the improvement in the quality of life and the expansion   of opportunities for our citizens,\" the draft document states.

Shao Jun, director of subsidiary Shougang Shipping Co., was given a   suspended death sentence in January by Beijing Intermediate People\\'s   Court, according to sources at the metallurgical ministry.   He was accused of accepting 640,000 yuan (76,000 dollars) in bribes.   Yang Liyu, assistant deputy general manager of the Beijing Iron and   Steel Co. of Shougang, another of the group\\'s subsidiaries, also   received a suspended death sentence for allegedly accepting 320,000   yuan in bribes.   Zhao Dongxiang, deputy general manager of the same company, was   sentenced to 10 years in prison.   The chairman of Shougang, Zhou Guanwu, resigned in February a few days   before the arrest of his son Zhou Beifang for alleged fraud.   Zhou Beifang was the head of Shougang\\'s two subsidiaries in Hong Kong.   One of them, Shougang Concord International, was also directed by Deng   Zhifang, the son of China\\'s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.   Deng Zhifang was also questioned in the case, according to unconfirmed   reports.   Shougang, or Capital Iron and Steel, one of China\\'s largest companies,   was chosen by Deng Xiaoping as a model for his free-market economic   reforms launched in the 1980s.   Meanwhile, Li Geng, a director of Shougang Concord, told the   Beijing-funded Ta Kung Pao newspaper that the company would concentrate   on core iron and steel businesses, under Bi Qun, the company\\'s new   chairman in Beijing.   \"We will no longer rush into buying new listed firms\" in Hong Kong, Li   said.   Under Zhou Beifang, the former chairman of Shougang Concord, the group   went on a two-year buying spree to acquire interests in several Hong   Kong-listed companies.

       " 'training-2585': {'body': \"   President Clinton, warning Tuesday that America ``cannot risk further   delay,'' abruptly abandoned efforts to win congressional approval of a   $40 billion loan guarantee for Mexico and resorted to unilateral action   to help stem that country's deepening economic crisis.   Clinton announced a new international package of emergency assistance   for Mexico totaling $47.5 billion. It includes $20 billion from the   U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund, $17.5 billion from the International   Monetary Fund and $10 billion in short-term lending from the Bank of   International Settlements, another lending organization.   The new package poses far less risk to American taxpayers than the   loan-guarantee program would have in case of a Mexican default,   officials said.   ``We must act now,'' Clinton told the National Governor's Association   in a hastily revised address barely 90 minutes after an emergency White   House meeting with congressional leaders and members of his Cabinet.   ``We cannot risk further delay.''   The widening economic crisis in America's huge trading partner   threatens ``thousands'' of American jobs and ``millions of dollars'' in   U.S. exports and promises to swell the ranks of illegal immigrants   streaming across America's southern border, Clinton said.   ``The risks of inaction are greater than the risks of decisive   action,'' the president said. ``This is the right thing to do.''   Clinton took the action after a sobering meeting with Republican and   Democratic leaders from both houses of Congress who bluntly warned him   that lawmakers would reject the quick rescue plan that had been the   goal of bipartisan negotiations for more than two weeks.   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry, emerging from the hour-long   meeting, said the Clinton administration and the independent Federal   Reserve would act in concert to try to halt the free-fall of plummeting   peso, which has lost 45 percent of its value in six weeks.   McCurry said Clinton would take unilateral executive action ``to help   stabilize the Mexican currency'' and to ``protect U.S. economic   interests.''   The president's spokesman said Tuesday's action won initial support   from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Senate Minority Leader Thomas   Daschle, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and House Minority Leader Richard   Gephardt during the White House meeting. The session also included   Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Robert   Rubin.   Clinton concluded from his meeting with lawmakers that ``the likelihood   of a congressionally-approved package has diminished significantly,''   McCurry explained. ``Given the urgency of the matter he intends to act   under his executive authority under the law.''   McCurry said that the president remained convinced that ``the best of   all circumstances would have been to have a package that had been   approved by Congress.'' But the urgency of the crisis required   immediate executive action, McCurry said.   Neither the president nor his Cabinet secretaries criticized leaders of   the GOP-controlled Congress for failing to push the measure with their   colleagues, McCurry emphasized. Clinton ``understands that it is   difficult for some members of Congress to understand the (loan   guarantee) package,'' McCurry said. ``But on the other hand, the   urgency to act and to protect the interests of Americans is clearly   foremost in the president's mind.''   McCurry said Clinton's executive action means that the U.S. part of the   international aid package would be about half the $40 billion target   initially set for the original U.S. loan-guarantee package for Mexico.   Action by other nations and international financial institutions such   as the International Monetary Fund ``has lessened some of the exposure   that would be taken by the United States,'' he said.   ``It's been clear from the outset of the crisis that we need to act   swiftly to help put Mexico in a better position to weather this   crisis,'' McCurry said.   Administration officials had argued that the loan-guarantee package   would not have been a large risk to American taxpayers. The Mexican   government would have paid a fee for the guarantees and the United   States would have had first call on Mexico's oil export revenues in   case of default.   But critics said the collateral would not have been enough if the   Mexican economy continued to slide. Opponents also portrayed the   package as a bailout for millionaire Wall Street investors and economic   planners in Mexico City.   U.S. Ambassador to Mexico James Jones said Tuesday that American   taxpayers face negligible financial exposure from the $20 billion being   drawn from the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund.   The Clinton administration has not decided whether to pledge the $20   billion as a loan guarantee or a line of credit, Jones said.   But Mexico's revenue from international oil sales will be used ``as an   assured means of repayment'' in the event of default by the Mexican   government, said Jones, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma.   The $17.5 billion line of credit from the International Monetary Fund   is in addition to $7.8 billion that the world lending agency approved   last week. The $10 billion from the Bank of International Settlements   is for short-term loans.   A Washington Post-ABC News poll, released Tuesday, showed that 71   percent of 1,026 adults surveyed said they opposed loan guarantees and   25 percent favored them.   Surveys in Mexico City have shown that a large majority of Mexicans   opposed accepting aid from the United States, contending that it would   compromise their nation's sovereignty.\",\n",

At the Lau WelNew Cultural Village, aboriginal peoples from throughout   the Commonwealth will showcase their own art, music, and food.   But at least one headache was resolved last week when striking city   workers agreed to submit their dispute to binding arbitration and go   back to work.   City officials and organisers had started to worry that more than 3,300   competitors from 67 countries arriving for the Games would be greeted   by weeks\\' worth of uncollected garbage.   On Friday, that fear was laid to rest when union chief Colin Graham   said: \"We have visitors coming. Our house is a little bit messy. We   have to tidy it up.\"   As well as the competitors, officials and 2,500 journalists, an   additional 70,000 visitors are expected for the Games.   Tourism is already the chief industry in the picturesque city, where an   atmosphere of 19th century England pervades.   So far ticket sales to actual sports events have been slow, but   organisers say they have covered their costs.   Lorne Whyte, chief executive of Victoria\\'s tourist board, said the   Games were expected to produce nearly 50 million Canadian dollars (36   million US) in increased tourism revenues this year.   The worldwide television audience could reach 300 million, and in   Canada itself television coverage has received a boost from the major   league baseball strike.   The lack of baseball games means Canadian TV will air six extra hours   of Games action.   In competition, Australia is widely expected to head the charge for   gold, led by a powerful swimming squad. Canada is hoping the home   advantage will boost their tally.

This time around, it's a different story.   When Diana arrives Monday for a four-day visit, her estranged husband,   Prince Charles, won't be accompanying her. The schedule hasn't been   finalized, but as of Thursday, there were no plans for meetings with   top government officials or members of the royal family.   Japan's Foreign Ministry describes the visit as unofficial, and because   Diana is not a state guest, the lack of such meetings is not   necessarily a protocol breach.   But the princess' luster may have dimmed a bit. In conservative Japan,   many view the huge scandal surrounding the breakdown of Charles and   Diana's marriage with distaste. The imperial family here is treated   with deep respect, and its members behave with near-total decorum.   By British standards, royal scandal in Japan tends to be pretty tame   stuff -- such as tabloid reports that Empress Michiko sometimes   inconvenienced her staff by asking for noodles late at night, or   speculation about whether Crown Princess Masako is pregnant.   Considering that Japan less than three weeks ago experienced its worst   natural disaster in more than 70 years -- an earthquake that killed   more than 5,100 people -- attentions are understandably focused   elsewhere, and there's been little flurry of anticipation over the   visit.   But one magazine trumpeted rumors that the government and royal family   are keeping Diana at arm's length because of her marital woes.   ``When you think about it, it might be easiest for her to visit quietly   and leave without going to the palace only to hear `How's Prince   Charles?' or `Give him our best wishes,' said a recent article in   Shukan Shincho, a popular weekly magazine. ``That would be easiest for   those receiving her as well.''   Buckingham Palace has called this a ``working visit,'' and so far the   schedule calls for events like hospital calls and embassy functions.   The schedule, as of Thursday, did not include a trip to   earthquake-ravaged Kobe, a stop Diana had reportedly said she would   like to make.   Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visited the city Tuesday. Officials   on both sides refused to comment on why Diana isn't scheduled to go to   the quake zone.   Meanwhile, officials at Japan's Imperial Household Agency, which   manages palace affairs, said as of Thursday there were no plans for   Diana to meet with her counterpart, Masako, or any other members of the   imperial family.   British Embassy spokesman Satomi Shinjo, asked whether it was unusual   for no palace tete-a-tete to be planned for visiting royalty, had no   comment.   ``All I can say is that at this time nothing is on the schedule,'' she   said.   Foreign Ministry officials said Diana's itinerary was still being   discussed, and meetings with the government or royalty could still be   added.   It's a far cry from Diana's 1986 visit, when nearly 100,000 people   lined the streets of Tokyo to catch a glimpse of her. She and Prince   Charles dined with the late Emperor Hirohito, were toasted by Prime   Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and given live, nationwide TV airtime.   Diana and Charles returned in 1990 for Emperor Akihito's enthronement   ceremony, and were the most popular of the dignitaries that came from   nearly 160 countries.\",\n",

       " 'training-0537': {'body': '   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has reiterated his administration\\'s   resolve to pay greater attention to agriculture because Nigerians have been   living with persistent rise in the food price in the past several months,   reported a radio program monitored here on Saturday.   Obasanjo, who made the remarks on the monthly radio program of \"The   President Explains\", noted that agriculture is \"renewable\" unlike oil,   gas and other resources.   \"Agriculture must be given a pride of place and we must have consistent   policies to boost agricultural production and local manufacturing,\"   Obasanjo said.   He pointed out that some countries that have no natural resources have   done better than Nigeria because they have good managers, skills and   technology.   \"This is a country that should be flowing with milk and honey but we   are poor today because we have mismanaged our resources. One of the   things we did in the past was to throw money at our problems rather   than working out real solutions,\" the president said.   He called on his countrymen to join hands to make the country a better   place politically, economically and socially.   Earlier on Wednesday, the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce,   Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), whose members are major   stakeholders in the agricultural sector, urged the government to   allocate 10 percent of the 2002 budget to agriculture in order to   effectively combat the food crisis on a long term basis.   The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization estimated that in   order to reduce the negative affection imposed by the long- term   negligence of the agricultural sector, the Nigerian government should   be progressively moved toward 25 percent of the budget by 2010.   The Nigerian government has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to   tackling the food crisis in the most populous African country. Earlier   last month, President Olusegun Obasanjo vowed that the government is   committed to making agriculture a dominant sector of the national   economy once again.   The government will do everything possible to help farmers, including   cultivating certain tree crops under the subsidizing agricultural   program, he said.   On the other hand, the government has set up a National Economic   Council Committee on food production to find ways of solving the   problem of food shortage in the country.   Meanwhile, the Nigerian Senate unanimously adopted a motion for seeking   to set 100 billion naira (870 million U.S. dollars) in an agricultural   development fund in a bid to check the food crisis in the country.   Agriculture was widely practised in Nigeria during the 1950s and the   1960s, when about 90 percent of the West African country\\'s population   was involved in agriculture.   However, when oil was discovered and being exploited and petro- dollar   started flowing into the nation, many young and energetic people   abandoned the farms, heading for oil-related jobs.   The prosperity of oil economy stimulated a massive rural to urban drift   or migration at the expense of national food security. Beginning from   the early 1980s, Nigeria has been degenerating into a food-importing   nation from a net food-exporting nation.   A recent World Bank report has warned that Nigeria is approaching   famine except the west African country takes the appropriate measures.   Because of drought in most parts of this country, Nigeria\\'s food   security has worsened since late last year.',\n",

Discouraged by a series of amendments in the Chamber of Deputies that   watered down the package, he said the confidence vote was necessary   ''for the Italian economy and thus the future of the entire national   collectivity.''   If Dini's government wins the confidence measure, the entire   deficit-reduction package would pass as he wants it. The package,   mainly new taxes, is designed to cut a dlrs 100 billion deficit.   The document passed last week in the Senate. But Dini doesn't have   clear support in the lower Chamber. He received a potential boost   Wednesday when an official of the ex-Christian Democrats said the   party's deputies would support him.   The confidence vote was scheduled for noon Thursday.

With six reigning world champions and four World Cup titlists in the   lineup, the 13-strong Chinese team looks set to once again dominate the   pool, as it did numerous times before at World Cups and University   Games.   Heading the team are Tian Liang, Olympic and World Championships   titlist on the men\\'s platform, and Guo Jingjing, who won double golds   in the women\\'s springboards at the Fukuoka Swimming World Championships   last month.   Others include Hu Jia, Wang Feng, Peng Bo and Wang Kenan, all of whom   won titles in men\\'s springboard or platform at the Fukuoka   championships. Wang Rui, who won silver in the women\\'s 10m platform at   the last Universiade in Palma, and Cai Yuyan, silver medalist in the   same event at the World Championships in 1998, are also on the list.   The most \"inexperienced\" hand in the team is probably Song Dinghui, a   20-year-old who will compete in the men\\'s 1m springboard. Even he has   won more than one gold at FINA Grand Prix and Asian Cup competitions.   Chinese team manager Zhou Jihong said China fielded a top-level team,   aiming to show its true strength at the games.   She said because of age requirements, some top divers are dropped from   the list, but the all otherwise eligible key members are included in   the team.   China\\'s superiority is all the more obvious in the absence of strong   rivals from Russia, Australia and Canada. The names of such diving   talents as Dmitry Sautin, Yulia Pakhalina and Irina Lashko are missing   from the lists.   Many foreign coaches and judges predict China will achieve no less   feats than they did last month in Fukuoka, when it took eight gold   medals out of 10 events at the Championships.   \"The Chinese team are too strong to beat,\" said Japanese coach Su Wei,   who is training his two men and two women divers in the Tsinghua   Natatorium. \"Their divers are excellent. We have to pin our hopes on   their mistakes, if they make any,\" he said, half jokingly.   German judge Gerd Volker shared the same sentiments. \"China are a very   good team. It\\'s hard for our divers to defeat them,\" he said.   Canadian coach Gao Min said although some other countries have produced   some good divers in recent years, China on a whole are still stronger   than others. \"China is No. one in the world, and nobody can threaten   its position at present,\" she said.   \"Chinese divers are the best, whether speaking in terms of difficulty,   stability or gracefulness of their dives,\" said Gao, a former Chinese   diver who had dominated the springboards herself in late 1980s and   early 1990s.   Gao believes the reason lies in the difference between the training   mechanisms in China and in other countries. \"With government support,   Chinese divers are trained under strict regimen and are ensured best   training facilities in the world. They can get to a very high level in   a comparatively short time. It\\'s hard for other countries\\' divers to   catch up,\" Gao said.   Meanwhile, Chinese coaches sound cautious about the medal prospects at   the Universiade. \"We can\\'t guarantee a sweep of all golds,\" said Zhang   Ting, who had coached Tian Liang to Olympic victory in Sydney.   \"Mexico, Japan, Cuba, they are all quite good,\" Zhang said. \" Look at   those two girls from the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea. I think   they are not bad,\" Zhang said, pointing to two women on a platform.   \"We can\\'t underestimate our rivals. We must make sure every dive is   done correctly without big technical mistake,\" he said.   So far, more than 100 divers from 25 countries have registered to take   part in the 10-event diving competition, organizing officials said.   China had a successful Universiade two years ago, winning four golds   and one silver in six events. They also got both men\\'s and women\\'s team   titles. With the inaugural synchronized events at this year\\'s   Universiade, China looks set to increase its haul of gold medals.   China\\'s best showing at Universiades were in 1987, when they swept all   four golds in as many events and won both team titles. The 1m   springboard events have not yet been introduced at that time.   In 1991, China triumphed again at the Sheffield Universiade, bagging   five golds out of six events and scooping both team titles.',\n",

Crows   are opportunistic feeders, she said, and might attack a lawn as a   likely source of nutritious grubs below the grass.   The culprits in lawn attacks are also frequently starlings, Ms. Hughes   said. ``If there is anything good that starlings do, it is attacking   grubs just below the surface of the lawn in the soil,'' she said. The   starling, Sternus vulgaris, is an alien species much despised by   birdwatchers for killing and taking over the nests of domestic   songbirds.   Starlings can be mistaken for crows because they exhibit two plumages:   a greenish, blackish, purplish irridescent one with a yellow bill in   summer, and an irridescent black plumage with white spots on the chest   and a black bill in winter.   The starling can be told from the crow by its shorter tail and browner   wings in flight and by its much smaller size. It is only 6 inches long,   while the most common crow species in North America, the American crow,   is easily twice as big, at 17 inches. The crow also has the distinctive   and familiar cry, ``Caw, caw.''

He said the EU was \"satisfied that the Commonwealth shares its analysis   that the elections were neither free nor fair,\" she said.   The surprise suspension came after the London-based 54-nation group   failed to reach agreement on sanctions against Harare before the   voting, when African leaders rallied around the anti-colonialist   Mugabe, who has held power since independence from Britain in 1980.   The EU spokeswoman refused to comment on the suspension, calling it \"an   internal decision\" of the Commonwealth, but added the union \"hoped   Mugabe will listen to the voice of the international community\" calling   for the democratisation of the country.

Iranian officials stepped up attacks on Israel and its chief ally, the   United States, as the country\\'s paramount leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei   urged Hezbollah guerrillas to strike back and make the Jewish state   pay.   Parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nategh-Nuri lashed out at the   international community for their \"deadly silence\" toward Thursday\\'s   shelling of a UN refugee compound in south Lebanon by Israel which   killed almost 100 people.   Anti-US and anti-Israeli propaganda flooded the airwaves, with news on   the polls mixed with images of bloody scenes from Israel\\'s attacks   against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.   Hardline conservatives, led by Nategh-Nuri, have seized the occasion to   urge the electorate not to vote for \"liberals,\" a term they use to   describe their moderate rivals close to President Ali Akbar Hashemi   Rafsanjani.   \"Vote for those who do not want to compromise with the United States,   those who have their hearts in the values of the (1979) Islamic   revolution,\" Nategh-Nuri said.   Radio or television sets were set up in all polling stations, where   voters were bombarded with speeches from leading political or religious   personalities denouncing liberalism.   The television broadcast excerpts from Khamenei speeches urging people   to bar from the parliament \"those whose antennae are tuned to the West   and the United States.\"   Although all the candidates have already been screened to ensure they   live up to the principles of the Islamic republic, Khamenei warned the   electorate on Friday to only vote for those \"who work for God and   religion.\"   His statements were clearly in favor of the conservatives, who are   backed by the Shiite Moslem clergy and demand \"absolute obedience\" to   Khamenei.   In the run-up to the polls, the conservatives, backed by state radio,   television and hardline newspapers, launched a bitter campaign to   discredit the moderates, accusing them of seeking to undermine the   values of the Islamic revolution.   A total of 246 hopefuls were contesting 123 seats in the 270-member   assembly undecided in the first-round vote. In Tehran, 56 candidates   vied for 28 seats up for grabs.   The conservatives won 88 of the 134 seats decided in the first round on   March 8 and they are hoping for another sweep over the reformists.   Appearing at a polling station to cast his vote, Rafsanjani said the   campign was \"harsh,\" but urged the two factions not to bear any grudges   and \"work together again after the election whatever the results are.\"   Voting was to last until 6 p.m. (1430 GMT), but the interior ministry   said it had extended the period for one hour to allow more people to   vote.

       " 'training-1594': {'body': \"   One of Switzerland's most progressive and popular bishops resigned in a   pregnancy scandal Friday, prompting new questions about celibacy rules   and new problems for the country's Roman Catholic church.   ``Since my election to bishop I have experienced heavier spiritual   burdens,'' said a statement by Hansjoerg Vogel, who took over last year   as bishop of Switzerland's largest diocese, Basel.   ``I thus sought greater support in a relationship with a woman I knew   previously. This relationship led to a pregnancy,'' said the   44-year-old Vogel in a letter to his ``brothers and sisters'' in the   diocese.   Pope John Paul II accepted the resignation of Vogel as 92nd bishop of   Basel, effective immediately. He named an auxiliary bishop, Monsignor   Joseph Candolfi, as temporary successor.   The Swiss Conference of Bishops said they learned of the resignation   with ``great sadness but equally great respect'' for Vogel.   In an outpouring of support, other leading church figures paid tribute   to the courage of Vogel in making the announcement.   Vogel could not be contacted. His motives for going public were   unclear. There had been no rumors in the Swiss press about his affair.   His statement implied the child had not yet been born but there was no   confirmation of this and no clue on the identity of the woman.   ``I know that my failings will disappoint many believers,'' said Vogel.   ``They had expectations of me which I couldn't fulfill ... I just   couldn't deal with my personal problems,'' he said.   There have been a series of sexual scandals in the Catholic church   worldwide, although this is the first in Switzerland.   In one of the most notorious cases, the archbishop of Santa Fe in New   Mexico resigned in 1993 after seven women alleged they had sex with   him, some while in their teens.   In 1992, Ireland was rocked by news that one of its leading bishops had   fathered a son 17-years before and given nearly dlrs 120,000 in church   funds to the mother.   Vogel, who spoke out in favor of ordaining married men as priests, said   he realized his case unintentionally would lead to a new discussion of   the requirement that priests stay single.   ``New mistrust will arise over whether priests really can carry out   their commitment to celibacy,'' he said. ``I still am convinced that   fulfilled life is possible in celibacy.''   However, the liberal theologian Rev. Hans Kueng disagreed and renewed   calls for the abolition of the ``inhuman and unchristian'' law.   ``When will the Swiss bishops, who will probably try to hide behind   silence again, declare openly that they want Rome to scrap this law,   which has caused so much hypocrisy in the Church and so much suffering   for the affected women,'' he said. Kueng, a Swiss who teaches in   Germany, is well-known for his clashes with Rome.   Vogel was the sixth Swiss bishop to stand down in less than two years _   most of the others were on health grounds.   During his short term as head of a flock of 1.1 million devout in the   Basel diocese, he earned widespread respect. As pastor in a parish in   Bern he had granted refuge to foreigners threatened with deportation   and earned a reputation for openness. Progressive Catholics saw him as   a symbol of hope and a counterweight to conservative bishops appointed   by the pope.   The Swiss Catholic Church has been deeply divided for the past five   years following the appointment of Wolfgang Haas, as Bishop of Chur,   the country's second biggest diocese.   Haas was accused of authoritarianism and his negative views on the role   of women, and many of his flock quit the church.   The Cathedral Chapter of Basel will elect Vogel's successor according   to its own ancient traditions which are independent of Rome. However,   the selection procedure is likely to rekindle the progressive verus   conservative debate. (cn-pvs)\",\n",

With the Muslim-led government on the offensive, and U.N. peacekeepers   ever more on the defensive, life in the capital and the other ``safe   areas'' is even tougher and more dangerous.   The rebel Serbs responded to the June 15 government offensive to break   Sarajevo's siege by shelling the city and the other enclaves. Shells   and sniper bullets killed 144 civilians and injured 608 in Sarajevo in   June _ compared to one dead and 10 injured in January.   The survivors have to struggle to stay alive. There has been no power   or running water since May 26, when the Serbs cut both in retaliation   for NATO airstrikes on their ammunition dumps.   Sevala Hodzic, 64, and her 70-year-old husband lug 10 liters (21 pints)   of water each day up 15 stories to their apartment.   ``I don't know how long we can continue like this,'' she sighed. ``This   is not life, this is hell, and one day I'll just drop dead.''   In the eastern enclaves of Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde, and the   northwestern area of Bihac, life is even worse.   Last weekend, Bihac reported its first victims of starvation: an   elderly man who left a note saying he was too proud to beg, and a   3-year-old who weighed 7 kilograms (15.4 pounds) at death.   Serbs on Thursday pounded Srebrenica, hitting a refugee center and a   camp for Dutch peacekeepers. Bosnian Radio reported several civilian   deaths, and the death toll was expected to rise.   For months, peacekeepers have been starved of fuel by rebel Serbs, who   dictate the flow of supplies, and have barely been able to patrol. In   Gorazde, British soldiers resorted to mules _ a sad symbol of the   entire peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.   Dispatched in the summer of 1992 to ensure aid deliveries, the 23,000   peacekeepers in Bosnia have received ever vaguer orders from world   leaders _ themselves so divided over the war that they could only agree   on alleviating the suffering instead of acting militarily to end it.   One controversial resolution came in June 1993, laying out terms for   protecting the ``safe areas'' declared a month earlier: Sarajevo, the   eastern enclaves, Bihac and the northern city of Tuzla.   The resolution empowered peacekeepers ``to deter attacks against the   safe areas,'' to occupy strategic points, to clear out troops not with   the Muslim-led government and to use force in self-defense.   U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali told the Security Council   on May 30 this year that peacekeepers are thus required to react to   Serb attacks, regardless of whether the Serbs are responding to a   government offensive or not.   But that order has never been clear to peacekeepers on the ground, and   answering with force would drag contributing governments into the   direct confrontation with the Serbs _ a confrontation the West has   sought to avoid.   Nor, apparently, can U.N. commanders agree how best to protect the   ``safe areas'' or help their inhabitants.   In June, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Rupert Smith of   Britain, presented a plan to U.N. superiors in Zagreb to use force to   open aid routes into Sarajevo. It was rejected.   Yet, this week, French peacekeepers have used their biggest gun, a 120   mm mortar, against Serb guns attacking U.N. and other vehicles on the   only mountain track into Sarajevo.   And in a new tactic, some of those U.N. peacekeepers' vehicles have   taken aid to Sarajevo's needy civilians.   Rebel Serbs, who shut down the city's vital airlift with repeated   attacks on planes in April, say that contravenes the U.N. mission only   to escort aid, not transport it.

A first meeting, called by President Vojislav Kostunica, broke up late   Friday without agreement on the draft legislation which would underpin   cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former   Yugoslavia.   Beta news agency reported that Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragisa Pesic,   Kostunica\\'s adviser Gradimir Nalic, both federal and Serbian justice   ministers Savo Markovic and Vladan Batic, as well as district   prosecutor Rade Terzic were trying to reach a compromise on details of   the bill.   Kostunica said on Thursday the Yugoslav Parliament could adopt a law on   cooperation with the UN war crimes tribunal in the coming days, raising   the prospect of the United States unblocking millions of dollars of   aid.   Washington decided to freeze 40 million dollars (46 million euros) in   aid to protest at Belgrade\\'s refusal to hand over war crimes suspects   that have been indicted by the UN tribunal in The Hague.   Beta quoted Markovic as saying that the participants had agreed not to   make details of the meeting public before Sunday.   Markovic said that the final draft would be presented to Montenegrin   coalition partners \"probably during the day (Saturday),\" adding that   they were expected to decide on Monday whether or not to support the   draft in the Yugoslav parliament.   The representatives from Montenegro, which with the larger Serbia makes   up what remains of federal Yugoslavia, have up till now opposed any   proposed law allowing for the extradition of Yugoslav citizens to face   trial in the international court.   If the Montenegrin camp drops its opposition to the extradition plan,   the proposed law could be examined by the federal government on Monday   and put to parliament for adoption on Tuesday or Wednesday, Dragoljub   Micunovic, a Yugoslav parliamentary speaker, said Friday after the   initial meeting.   \"Not to adopt this law could have catastrophic consequences,\" he added.   Also on Friday, US envoy Pierre-Richard Prosper warned Belgrade that   the time was \"running out\" and that it risked losing US support over   the issue.   Tribunal officials say that about 15 people wanted by the Hague court   live in hiding in Serbia.',\n",

So McGriff is back at home in Tampa, palling around with Eric and   hitting the little white ball. He even admits in a round-about way that   he doesn't really miss the game, adding, ``If I say that, people will   get the impression I really don't care.   ``But what they don't realize is that this is the first time I have   gotten to spend with my family like this. When we were playing, I had   to leave at 3 in the afternoon every day and Eric didn't understand   that. Now I see him when he gets up and when he goes down. It's nice.''   And this comes from a player on the verge of a career season, with 34   home runs and 94 RBIs through 114 games. McGriff said he doesn't really   think about what could have been, however.   ``I could be selfish and say, `Let's go back out there,' '' he said.   ``But I can't be selfish. I have to think about the other people, the   ones before me that sacrificed. We'll start playing again when the   owners give up the salary cap. We've seen what the salary cap has done   in football. Talk to Stan (Kasten). The ball is in their court.''   McGriff, like many players, is ready to wait it out, even if it goes   well into next season. Does he miss the paycheck, a cool $20,718 a day,   which has added up to $393,642?   ``It's just one of those things,'' he said. ``We had been paid for   two-thirds of the season. We'll survive. We have to look long-range. I   don't think anybody is hurting.''   McGriff said the only teammate he has talked to is Mark Lemke, who is   his best friend on the club. And other than golf and some tossing with   Eric in the backyard, he said he has done no conditioning work.   ``It would take me three or four days to get back into it,'' he said.   ``Hitting is all mechanical, so it is really no big deal. But something   is going to happen, something quick to save it. September is going to   be a big.   ``I think everybody wants to come back and play. But I can't say that I   haven't enjoyed the two or so weeks I have had off. It sure does   something for your aches and pains.''   So does Eric. .\",\n",

       " 'training-1755': {'body': \"   Republican congressional leaders endorsed a French proposal Thursday to   create a rapid-reaction force to protect U.N. forces is Bosnia but   balked at helping pay for it with U.S. funds or committing American   troops to the operation.   The demands by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader   Bob Dole prompted the United Nations Security Council meeting in New   York to postpone a vote that had been scheduled for Thursday on   creating the force.   In a letter to President Clinton, Gingrich and Dole insisted that any   U.N. resolution make clear that the cost of the force would be assessed   to U.N. members and that ``no additional U.S. financial or military   obligations will be incurred as a result of the resolution.''   Gingrich and Dole said in the letter that efforts by the French and   other countries with troops in Bosnia to protect their forces ``should   be respected.''   But they said the French President Jacques Chirac, in a meeting with   them earlier this week, ``assured us he was only seeking U.S. political   support, and not a financial commitment.''   ``In view of this assurance, we would not object to your   administration's decision to support President Chirac's efforts to   protect UNPROFOR (U.N. protective force) troops,'' Gingrich and Dole   wrote.   The Clinton administration had been holding up U.N. consideration until   it could get a sense of the congressional reaction. The United Nations   had envisioned the United States paying about one-third of the force's   cost, estimated to total $270 million for the first six months.   A U.S. official, briefing reporters at the United Nations on condition   of anonymity, said the ``unsolved congressional problem'' over funding   was holding up approval.   ``We are working with Congress. We want to meet the reasonable concerns   of Congress,'' the official said ``Congress is expressing its   frustration at how UNPROFOR is operating. It is questioning whether an   additional budgetary obligation should be incurred.''   The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Clinton   administration is exploring funding options. He said one possibility is   making the funding voluntary.   Clinton, the official said, was expected to discuss the issue with   other Group of Seven leaders holding an economic summit this week in   Halifax, Canada.   Dole and Gingrich said Chirac had assured them that troops in the   proposed force would wear their national uniforms, not the U.N. blue   helmets. The troops also would not be subject to vetoes by U.N.   officials that members of Congress have blamed for crippling the   operation in Bosnia.   ``We would like to emphasize that our concurrence for measures to   protect UNPROFOR, such as the RRF, should in no way be interpreted as   support for the present European and administration approach to the war   in Bosnia,'' they wrote.\",\n",

Zare, several colleagues and their spouses studied the admittedly minor   problem of storing unfinished bottles of sparkling wine.   Their findings burst the bubble on the European practice of dangling a   silver spoon in the neck of the bottle. And Zare's own hypothesis --   that recapping the bottle works best -- also went flat.   ``To my surprise I found that recorking ... didn't do anything for it.   In fact, it got the worst result in terms of people's sense of taste,''   he said.   Makers of sparkling wine were amused -- but continued to recommend that   open bottles be restopped and returned to the refrigerator.   ``But I think it sounds like a fun study,'' said Todd Graff, a   winemaker at Schramsberg Vineyards. He said many things affect   sparkling wine, which is properly called champagne only if it comes   from France's Champagne region.   Zare and Harold McGee, a noted writer on the science of food and   cooking, gathered six other tasters. They spent up to dlrs 200 of their   own money on sparkling wine, mostly from California.   The researchers found mixed results with the spoons. They gave the   highest rating to the wine left open for a day.   ``That was a big surprise to me,'' Zare said. ``We found we liked the   bottles that had been allowed to stand better.''   Zare thinks bubbly, like some other wines, may benefit by being allowed   to ``breathe.'' This would dissipate any unsavory gases that may have   formed and increase the wine's contact with oxygen, aging it a bit   more.   He looks forward to resuming more testing of what he calls ``fizzics''   on New Year's Eve.   ``This research doesn't cease,'' he said.\",\n",

The five principles put forth by the Chinese Premier for guiding the   development of relations between China and Latin America are:   -- strengthening political dialogue between countries to increase   mutual understanding and trust;   -- engaging in economic and technological cooperation in various forms   to promote common development;   -- increasing people-to-people exchange to enlarge the areas for   exchange and cooperation;   -- supporting each other in international affairs to safeguarding the   interests of developing countries;   -- and seeking to establish normal state relations with those countries   which have not established diplomatic ties with China on the principles   of peace and co-existence.   In his speech, Li also proposed four areas of priority for enlarging   economic and trade cooperation between China and countries in Latin   America and the Caribbean Region.   The four aspects of priority for enlarging cooperation include:   -- enthusiastically enlarging bilateral trade;   -- endeavoring to develop cooperation between enterprises;   -- attaching importance to the development and utilization of natural   resources through the form of joint venture;   -- and strengthening exchanges in science and technology.   Li's speech also covered progress made in the development of ties and   cooperation between China and Latin America, China's development and   the gains borne out of his current three-nation Latin-American tour.   The Chinese premier called for joint efforts to open a new chapter in   the development of relations between China and Latin America.

The strike, which could hurt Germany\\'s budding economic recovery and   the government ahead of September elections, will be extended to the   eastern states of Berlin and Brandenberg at a later, unspecified date.   Some 50,000 workers at 21 companies in Baden-Weurttemberg, which is   home to auto giant DaimlerChrysler, will start strikes Monday, with   about 80 companies in all in the state expected to be affected by the   end of next week.   \"No employer will be able to know from one day to the next that   production will be up and running,\" said IG Metall official Juergen   Peters, when the timing for the strike was announced after a meeting of   the union executive in Frankfurt.   The strikes are aimed at pressing home demands for a wage increase that   was initially set at 6.5 percent but which could probably be settled at   just over four percent.   The Gesamtmetall employers\\' federation last offered a 15-month deal,   including a one-off payment of 190 euros (170 dollars) for the first   two months and wage increases of 3.3 percent for the other 13 months.   The union described the offer as a provocation.   Speaking after the executive meeting, IG Metall chief Klaus Zwickel   said: \"It is the employers who bear the full responsibility for the   wage conflict coming to a head.\"   \"As the strike drags on, things won\\'t become simpler. And it\\'s already   clear it won\\'t get cheaper,\" Zwickel said.   After weeks of short warning stoppages, the union now plans to try a   new tactic of so-called \"flexi-strikes\" with day-long strikes being   held by different companies on different days of the week.   \"We will hit enterprises at their nerve centres -- their production   efficiency,\" Peters said.   Gesamtmetall has said it would not rule out resorting to lock-outs in   response to the strikes.   The way the pay dispute is resolved is expected to set the tone for   upcoming wage rounds in the mining industry, increasing its importance   for the slowly improving German economy.   Last minute calls for restraint by Economy Minister Werner Mueller have   gone unheeded by union leaders. \"Strikes are not a good thing during a   period of economic upturn,\" Mueller has said.   And Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose centre-left government faces an   election on September 22, is not the only one concerned about the   strike and its effects.   \"The outcome of the ongoing wage negotiations in some regions of the   euro area could become a matter of concern,\" European Central Bank   President Wim Duisenberg told a press conference on Thursday.   \"Excessive wage increases could create additional cost pressure with   potential consequences not only for prices but also -- to an even   greater extent -- for employment creation and real gross domestic   product (GDP) growth.\"   Duisenberg did not specify which talks he was referring to, saying only   that \"in Germany, I\\'m certain that people will understand very well   what I\\'m talking about.\"   The last major strikes by IG Metall, in Bavaria in 1995, left Germany\\'s   giant automobile sector largely unscathed, but Zwickel has said the   union would have the industry in its sights this time around.',\n",

       " 'training-2121': {'body': '   Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today that the Chinese government   will resolutely control the margin of price rise, aiming to ensure that   price rises slow down considerably as compared with last year and stay   at around 15 per cent.   In the Report on the Work of the Government delivered to the Third   Session of the Eighth National People\\'s Congress (NPC), Li admitted   that \"an evident problem last year is the excessive rise in prices.\"   In the work report last year, Li said that the retail prices should be   kept from rising by more than 10 percent.   \"Although we made great efforts in this respect, retail prices rose by   21.7 percent, of which about 13 percentage points resulted from the   rise in prices of foods,\" he said. \"All this aroused great resentment   in the masses.\"   To put the price rise under control, Li said that the Chinese   government will take measures in the follow four aspects:   Firstly, vigorous efforts will be made to develop agricultural   production and increase supplies.   Secondly, the government will continue controlling the quantity of   currency issued and the scale of credit by applying a moderately tight   financial policy and keeping expenditures within the limit of income.   He said that the deficit in the central budget should not exceed that   of the previous year; and the local finance should maintain a balance   between revenue and expenditure; and the management of extrabudgetary   funds should be stepped up.   Thirdly, Li said, the scale of investment in fixed assets should be   brought under control and so should the excessive growth of consumption   funds.   And fourthly, China will deepen the reform of the circulation system,   step up the building of a market system, cut down on circulation   intermediaries and lower circulation charges.   Since China is a developing country, Li said, only moderate consumption   is applicable and a high level of consumption should not be advocated.   It is necessary to adhere over a long period of time to the principle   of plain living and hard struggle and of building up the country with   industry and thrift, Li said. \"Extravagance and waste should be   rejected.\"   Li pointed out that effective measures should be adopted this year to   improve the living standard of people in both urban and rural areas,   but the growth of funds for consumption should be slower than the   growth of the economy, and the rise in incomes of staff and workers   should be lower than that of labor productivity.   \"We should be concerned with the living conditions of people in   poverty-stricken areas, the low-income earners and retirees, and   earnestly help solve their difficulties,\" he said.   Li articulated that China will strengthen the control and supervision   over prices, especially those for daily necessities, improve the order   of circulation, oppose unfair competition, and take strong measures to   crack down on the production and sale of fake or poor quality   commodities and the making of exorbitant profits.   The readjustments in pricing have been carried out fairly quickly in   recent years, he said. The task this year is to offset the effect of   price rises in the past few years and generally speaking, no new   price-regulating measures will be taken. The pricing reform should   focus on establishing and improving the system of market management and   price control.   Li admitted that such a sharp rise in prices last year was due both to   objective reasons and to mistakes of governments at all levels.   First, last year China readjusted the prices for many commodities and   adopted many reform measures that affected prices. But the government   had underestimated the repercussions of these measures.   Second, China invested insufficiently in agriculture. Some areas   slackened their efforts to produce grain and implement the \"market   basket\" project, which resulted in a sharp rise in the prices of   agricultural products.   Third, there had been a rapid growth of investment in fixed assets and   consumption funds, and too much currency had been put into circulation   for several years running. The government did not take emergency   measures to stop these practices or launch an overall austerity program   in order to prevent a sharp decrease in economic growth, but thereby   increased the difficulty in curbing price rises.   Fourth, management of the market and prices was slackened to some   extent. The legal system was not yet sound; the market still needed to   be standardized; there were too many price rises and charges were   common.   Li said that under the circumstances of socialist market economy, it is   necessary for the government to control and administrate the prizes of   some commodities essential to the national economy and people\\'s   livelihood.',\n",

Abu Fattuh was arrested on October 9 with 14 others. Abdel Maqsud was   taken by police on Friday at Cairo airport as he prepared to leave for   Turkey.

As the negotiators began their second day of talks at this Red Sea   resort, Israeli spokesman Moshe Fogel said his side was \"trying to   focus on Hebron, but the Palestinians are trying to focus on a whole   gamut of issues.\"   \"The Palestinians want to bring in other issues which is holding up the   possibility of reaching a quick agreement on Hebron,\" another Israeli   official told AFP.   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat for his part insisted that the   talks must deal with all unfulfilled Israeli commitments, including   easing a closure of Palestinian areas, the release of Palestinian   prisoners, opening a Palestinian airport in Gaza, safe passageways   between self-rule areas in Gaza and the West Bank, and water sharing.   Another Palestinian negotiator, Hannan Asfour, rejected Israeli charges   that the Palestinian side was stalling in the talks in hopes of   improving their negotiating position.   \"The Palestinian side is serious and has always been serious, it\\'s the   Israeli side that has not been serious,\" he told reporters.

Israel is seeking changes in the Oslo accord\\'s terms for withdrawing   from Hebron so as to improve security guarantees for a small group of   Jewish settlers living amid the city\\'s 120,000 Arab residents.   Israel radio said the key stumbling block involved Israeli demands that   buffer zones be created between the Jewish areas and zones due to come   under Palestinian control, a project Arafat on Wednesday charged was a   \"racist\" plan to introduce a kind of \"apartheid\" into Hebron.   US mediator Dennis Ross met meanwhile in Gaza City with Arafat to   discuss the ongoing negotiations.   Ross had earlier convinced both sides to postpone the start of the Taba   negotiations for two days, believing that smaller, informal contacts   would be more fruitful than full-fledged talks between delegations.',\n",

In an emergency session Wednesday, the council\\'s parliamentary assembly   is to vote on a recommendation that new elections be held to restore   confidence in Albania\\'s democracy.   Albania is a member of the 39-state council, a pan-European body which   promotes democracy and human rights.   The recommendation came Tuesday from the council\\'s political affairs   committee which held talks with Albanian political parties.   The committee is also recommending a fact-finding mission be sent to   Albania.   The recommendation comes a day after the Organisation for Security and   Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which monitored the elections, pressed   Albania to hold new polls.   President Sali Berisha\\'s Democratic Party won 122 of the parliament\\'s   140 seats in the poll held over two rounds on May 26 and June 2.   Further polling was held in 17 constituencies on June 16 after the   previous ballot was invalidated because of fraud.   \"Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of pluralist democracy.   They constitute an essential condition for Council of Europe   membership,\" the committee said. \"Free expression of the will of all   parts of the Albanian population must be guaranteed.\"   The committee also called on Albania\\'s government not to take any major   legislative initiatives before the elections have been re-run.

Speaking at a joint news conference capping two days of talks, the   leaders of the two super-powers produced five joint statements -- one   on European security, one on a US-Russia economic initiative, three on   arms control.   Clinton, wheelchair-bound but vigorous and good-humoured, described the   accords reached at the two-day summit as \"dramatic and very substantial   results that I\\'m very pleased with.\"   Yeltsin, on his first foreign trip in almost a year and also in   fighting form, agreed. \"We made progress.\"   On the thorny issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation\\'s   expansion into central and east Europe \"they continued to disagree\"   with Yeltsin again underscoring \"Russian concerns that NATO enlargement   will lead to a potentially threatening build-up,\" a joint statement   said.   But Clinton wrenched a significant concession from Yeltsin, who agreed   to speed up negotiations with NATO in the following weeks on a document   that would enshrine NATO-Russia ties.   In Brussels, NATO chief Javier Solana welcomed the accord as   \"positive.\"   The document, bringing Russia closer to NATO, would be signed at the   highest political level by the 16 alliance members and Russia, and   would contain pledges of non-deployment by NATO of nuclear weapons and   troops on the territories of new member states, as well as provide for   joint decision-making.   Russia\\'s agreement to hammer out such a pact, to be finalised \"within   weeks\" by Solana, is a major concession to the United States.   Moscow previously had demanded a cast-iron treaty ratified by the   parliaments of the NATO states, a demand rejected out of hand by NATO.   Yeltsin both maintained Russian pride and face by penning in his   opposition to enlargement -- a cause celebre at home -- and won key   pledges from the US side.   Clinton, criticised at home for being too soft on the Russians, for his   part yielded no ground on enlargement, his top foreign policy priority.   With the Russians clamouring to be allowed into major international   institutions, Clinton announced the next G7 summit of industrialised   nations in Denver in June would be a G8. He also pledged to help win   membership for Russia into other global clubs, such as the Paris Club,   the World Trade Organisation and the OECD.   Washington too will back US private investment in Russia in a bid to   boost Yeltsin\\'s struggle to reform the country\\'s flagging economy.   On European security, the two leaders announced a joint plan to reduce   strategic nuclear warheads in both countries to 2,000 to 2,500 each by   2007, an 80-percent cut in such weaponry compared with the peak levels   of the Cold War.   The final talks of the two-day summit in icy Helsinki, centered on   security in post-Cold War Europe and Russia\\'s role on the continent   seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, took place in a secluded   modern villa surrounded by pine trees, overlooking the Baltic.',\n",

Saturday\\'s purge in the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP)   included a party founder, a vice-chairman of parliament and the   influential chairman of the assembly\\'s Commission on Human Rights.   A request for their dismissal from parliament will be presented soon,   according to BLDP president Ieng Mouly. All are expected to be   unseated.   \"The liberal, pluralistic democracy that the Cambodian constitution   requires is being lost as we speak,\" a parliamentary advisor told AFP,   noting the expulsions came hours after visiting US Secretary of State   Warren Christopher had praised Cambodia\\'s progress in that area.   \"The National Assembly is now a 100-percent rubber-stamp parliament,\"   he said.   Though the BLDP is small and the two main parties in the three-party   coalition government control all but 11 seats in the 120-member   national assembly, it has been a haven for protectors of human rights.   Many fear, that role is about to end.   \"No MP can now not follow their party line and all the party lines are   converging, so for intents and purposes, there is only one party,\" said   one longtime political observer.   But Ieng Mouly, also the Minister of Information, called the expulsions   a purely internal matter and said gloomy assessments of Cambodian   democracy were not appropriate.   \"There is no problem for loyal opposition as long as MPs are   responsible about it,\" he said Sunday. \"The BLDP will contine to be a   strong opponent in the assembly of what is wrong.\"   He added that the BLDP would soon propose legislation to prohibit the   expulsion from parliament of MPs who lose membership in their party, a   contentious issue since June when former finance minister Sam Rainsy   was ousted from parliament after being dismissed from the royalist   FUNCINPEC party.   Legal authority for such expulsions is unclear, but for the moment, Sam   Rainsy\\'s case provides a dangerous precedent, according to the United   Nations Special Representative for Human Rights in Cambodia, Michael   Kirby.   It \"is contrary to international principles and probably contrary to   Cambodian law\" and \"is a worrying development for the future of   democracy in Cambodia,\" Kirby said Saturday on his arrival in the   country.   BLDP founder Son Sann, the octogenarian \"national face\" of the party;   his son, vice president of the national assembly, Son Soubert; chairman   of the national assembly human rights commission, Kem Sokha; another MP   and two other members were all expelled from the party.   Those six led by Son Sann had been engaged in a power struggle with a   faction loyal to Ieng Mouly who took control of the BLDP in early July   at a party congress which the six boycotted.   Son Sann, who is out of the country, has said the congress was   \"illegal\" and has called for a new one to be held on October 1.',\n",

In a statement carried by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the   Yugoslavia government described Westendorp\\'s decision as an   illegitimate and \"unprecedented tyrannic\" action.   The decision is a most serious violation of the 1995 Dayton accord, the   Bosnian Constitution and the Bosnian Serb republic constitution and a   heavy blow to the Bosnian peace process, the statement said.   This move shows that the West\\'s top peace envoy detracts and disregards   the sense of sovereignty of the voters in the Serb republic, it said.   Carlos Westendorp, who is said to have sweeping powers to implement the   Dayton accord, dismissed Poplasen, accusing him of endangering the   Bosnian peace process.   A Bosnian Serb television report quoted Poplasen as saying that he   would not accept the \"illegitimate and undemocratic\" decision.   Poplasen said he would only step down in the \"same democratic way as he   was elected\" and that there should be a referendum to decide on the   issue.   Westendorp went into action after Poplasen began proceedings this week   to sack Western-backed Prime Minister Dodik.   The envoy accused Poplasen of abusing his powers by refusing to   nominate a prime minister able to win a parliamentary majority.

I will not   authorize firearms in the cockpit,\" Magaw told a Senate panel flatly.   \"I wish you would reconsider that,\" responded Senator Conrad Burns, one   of a number of legislators backing US airline pilots\\' demands that they   be allowed to carry guns aboard passenger planes to help prevent a   repeat of the attacks that killed some 3,000 people last year.   \"Pilots need to concentrate on flying the plane,\" Magaw said, adding   that the administration would likely make a formal statement on the   issue later in the week.   But Representative Don Young, chairman of the House committee,   dismissed that argument.   \"The events of September 11 have dramatically changed how we must   defend our planes and our passengers,\" he said.   \"I strongly believe that under these new circumstances, we must allow   trained and qualified pilots to serve as the last line of defense   against such a potential disaster.\"   Young and Mica are introducing legislation to create a program under   which pilots can volunteer to carry a gun to defend the cockpit.   The legislation is due to be voted on at the subcommittee level on   Thursday, and out of the full committee by mid-June, Mica told   reporters.   \"Any aid and assistance we can give is absolutely necessary,\" he said.   Congress passed legislation last year permitting pilots to carry   handguns at the discretion of the airlines and President George W.   Bush\\'s administration. But the plan to arm pilots was never enacted.   To date, the Bush administration has preferred to boost airline   security by improving safety checks and having armed air marshals on   board commercial flights.   Arguing that the safety of their passengers was at stake, pilots had   said that only lethal force could counter a deadly threat.   Some of the 114,000 pilots in the United States said in early May that   a petition to that effect addressed to Bush had gathered close to   45,000 signatures.   \"The objective is to protect the plane,\" Young insisted. \"The job of   the pilot is to make sure there is no invasion of the cockpit, and he   needs a firearm to do that.\"   In the Senate, lawmakers supporting the pilots\\' demands said in early   May that they were introducing legislation calling for a training   program to arm airline pilots that would start within six months.   Department of Transportation officials\\' concerns regarding airline   liability in the event that guns are used could be addressed by   removing such liability, they added at the time.   \"This is not going to be a Wild West show,\" Young said, adding that   pilots would use guns only \"to deter someone from entering the   cockpit.\"',\n",

He was being treated in a hospital in the Kenyan capital and all visits   were banned, according to a notice on his room door.   The French embassy here and a nurse at the hospital said he seemed to   be in good health, but was tired and had to undergo some medical tests.   \"The doctor will decide when he can receive visitors,\" said a nurse,   asking not to be named.   His brother, Gabriel Klem, told AFP he had spoken to Jean-Pierre by   telephone for the first time in 18 months. \"His speech was a bit slow,   but he seems to be all right in his head,\" he said.   However, mystery still surrounded the exact circumstances of Klem\\'s   release, with the French embassy treating the issue with great   sensitivity.   And it also remained unclear whether Klem had been held against his   will or not.   The French foreign ministry said Wednesday he had been detained by the   SPLA, but there has never been any ransom demand from the rebel group   which is fighting the Islamic regime in Khartoum.

The greenback stood in late afternoon at 1.3985 marks compared with   1.41 marks before the Bundesbank decision, which was announced at the   start of the noon-hour, and 1.4055 marks Tuesday evening in London.   Operators had not generally expected any reduction of the central   bank's key interest rates, but some had not ruled out a small cut in   the repo rate - which did not occur. It would have been aimed at   helping the German economy, which has been hurt by the mark's strength.   Keith Edmonds, an analyst at Industrial Bank of Japan, commented that   the market reacted badly to comments by Bundesbank officials that   seemed firmer than usual. Bank President Hans Tietmeyer noted the   difficulty of getting a correct view of the German economic situation   in view of a change in the way of calculating statistics - which now   take in the united country.   He said the situation should be clearer in September, which the market   took to rule out any rate cut in the meantime.   Edmonds said the dollar should now stabilize pending results of the   Group of Seven summit meeting starting on Thursday in Halifax, Canada.   Operators have continued to fear concerted central bank intervention   and hence have avoided large-scale dollar selling, said the analyst.   European currencies generally gained a bit against the masrk,   especially sterling, which benefited from the maintenance of the UK   inflation target of 1 to 4 percent a year, announced by the Treasury.   The lira firmed in what operators called a correction of the drop   caused early in the week by the results of Sunday's referendums in   Italy.

If found guilty she could face a maximum three years in jail, although   people here are seldom jailed for such offences.   On her latest appearance she again made no plea and the case was   adjourned to August 25.

She was greeted outside the polling venue by Prime Minister Jim Bolger   and pictures of her voting went around the world. Bolger later gave   Mandela a framed copy of the picture.   Two months ago Television New Zealand (TVNZ) revealed her vote had not   counted because she was not South African, but Zimbabwean.

The Cour des Comptes said in an annual report submitted Monday to   President Jacques Chirac and the two chambers of parliament that the   actual passenger numbers for a new bulletin train line, TGV-Nord, will   only be a third of what the SNCF promised when asking the state to   finance the project.   The daily newspaper Le Monde said that the annual report of Cour des   Comptes has always provided \"a illumination on the malfunction of the   state, the local community and public enterprises,\" with \"that of 1996   confirming this tradition.\"   The report, submitted by Pierre Joxe, president of Cour des Comptes,   said that the interior traffic in 1994 was lower than half of what the   SNCF predicted, and that the SNCF has tripled its estimations of the   traffic across the English Channel in 1997.   It accused SNCF of basing its estimations on \"old data of four years   ago, while it could have used recent statistics available,\" in order to   obtain the rate of return to justify its investment in such a project.   The Cour des Comptes called on the government to re-examine a 1992   project to build a TGV line in northern France which was made with the   same method, while exposing \"numerous violations of market rule\" by the   state company, including ignoring the obligation of making   advertisements, bad management in biddings of competitive investment,   and little transparency in decision makings.   The Cour des Comptes also accused the EDF of turning what it first   promised to be a national energy providing center into an experimental   laboratory.   Given the failures and incidents in the functioning of the nuclear   super-generator Superphenix of the past 10 years in Creys-Malville,   department of Isere in central France, the Cour des Comptes is   questioning its \"disputable choice\" of a German partner in the project   and \"gaps in its management.\"   The report said that from 1984 to 1996, this nuclear energy center has   worked for only 30 months, while the rest of the time was taken by   incidents, stoppage and recovery.   It estimated that the cost for the center is around 60 billion   francs(12 billion U.S. dollars) up to the year 2000, while that for its   dismantling will be about 15 percent of the cost of its construction.',\n",

In its study, Dataquest, a California-based leader in the market   intelligence industry, picked out dynamic random access memory (DRAM)   because of the strong effect of its market volatility. The company made   forecasts of the semiconductor market with and without DRAM.   With DRAM, worldwide semiconductor revenue will reach 155 billion U.S.   dollars in 1999.

The mission will come after making a business trip to Kenya, the   officials said.   The British trade mission, the third this year, will be led by the   Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest in Britain, which   paid a successful visit to Tanzania last November.   In April, the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland mission   visited Tanzania, followed by the Sussex Chamber of Commerce delegation   in July.   The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, established in 1813, provides a   vital role in helping the business community in Britain to pursue   overseas opportunities.   David Frost of the chamber will be accompanying the representatives of   the wide-ranging companies as the Mission Manager.   British trade officials said companies taking part in the mission   include Ashville Trading, which provides boarding school education and   English language training; Huntleigh Healthcare, manufacturers of   textile recyclers; Orchard International, which produces domestic   appliances and Property Owners of London Ltd., which engages in project   management and property investment.   Other companies include Red Dragon Rail, which produces rehabilitated   and new railway rolling stock, Regentsgold (Design) Ltd., manufacturers   of reproduction furniture; Skatoskalo, a producer of internal tube   cleaning equipment, as well as Tansales (London) Ltd., which makes   electrical goods for construction industry.

       " 'training-0343': {'body': \"   of gathering to take stock, give thanks and look to the future.   The Rev. William Harper, 36, an Episcopal priest on Bainbridge Island,   a ferry's commute from Seattle, has planned just such a weekend.   Well, sort of.   As soon as his Sunday service is over, Harper will gather his wife,   Carolyn, their 3-year-old son, Blake, and a duffle bag of Polartec   provisions. His Subaru's roof rack laden with snowboards, he will head   for the trails of Mount Baker, two hours away, to ``bust some fatties''   -- execute some high jumps. As he carves plumes of powder, ``I'll   probably thank the Lord for snow -- and lots of it,'' he said.   Last spring, on Hunter Mountain, in New York state, Harper, 35,   switched from Alpine skiing to snowboarding. If the forecast of experts   is correct, his conversion will not be unique.   This winter, snowboarding will move from the renegade perimeter of   winter sports to its mainstream. Mary Jo Tarallo of Ski Industries   America in McLean, Va., a trade group, said that with close to 2   million riders during 1993, compared with 10.7 million skiers,   ``snowboarding is the fastest growing winter sport.''   Snowboards -- are also proving to be one of design's new frontiers.   Architects, graphic and fashion designers, the television and recording   industries are all finding fresh inspiration in a sport that has   origins in the music of Seattle garage bands and hiphop street style.   Creatively speaking, board design is music video's closest cousin.   Today's laminated fiberglass snowboards are latter-day versions of the   psychedelic posters of the '60s -- cultural billboards whose   appropriated images paint a picture of rider values.   ``Our roots are in an aggressive extension of skateboarding,'' said   Greg Dileo, 28, the marketing director for Division 23, a Torrance,   Calif., snowboard company that was started in January 1993. But the   sport, he added, is ``totally image driven.''   Harper's snowboard looks at first to be solid matte black, a reference   to his clerical shirt. But a closer look shows that it's decorated tip   to tip with a tree of life, earth objects and creatures and a face like   Moses's.   The design is barely noticeable (``so as not to offend the skiers I   still spend time with,'' Harper says) and he says ``secretly covets'' a   more radical Division 23 design: the face of Christ on a series of   television screens.   Niels Bendsten of Vancouver, British Columbia, a designer with a chair   in the Museum of Modern Art's collection, is well placed to smell the   coffee when it comes to design trends. He runs a 9,000-square-foot home   furnishings retail store, called Inform, and supplies the chairs for   Starbucks Coffee outlets.   Two years ago, after introductory lessons at nearby Whistler Mountain,   he was hooked. At 48, he began producing his own line of snowboards,   called Option, which has grown from a few hundred snowboards in its   first year to 6,000 projected for this season. Last season, the company   earned $3 million.   Donald Cassell, 34, an architectural designer and strip-mall developer   in Venice, Calif., caught the same wave as Bendsten. He launched Hazmat   Snowboards in 1992, and watched volume grow from 940 boards to 4,320   last year.   There are many versions of the genesis of snowboarding. Some East Coast   devotees attribute it to Jake Burton, the founder of Burton Snowboards,   an industry leader based in Burlington, Vt. Aficionados in the Pacific   Northwest are likely to tell you about Seattle skateboarders looking   for ways to have fun on Mount Baker.   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\",\n",

With its win, Salzburg moved to 2nd place on the standings with 5   points, three points behind group leader Ajax Amsterdam. Ajax beat   Milan in Trieste, Italy, 2-0 and secured a place in the quarterfinals   of the competition.   Milan dropped to third place with three points followed by AEK with   two.   The two top teams in each of the four groups qualify for the   quarterfinals.   On December 7, Salzburg will host Milan in Vienna in a game which will   determine which team will follow Ajax in the final eight of the   Champions League.   Salzburg was more aggressive in the first minutes of the game, and went   ahead in the 6th with a header by Pfeifenberger on a free kick by   Mladen Mladenovic.   Three minutes later, Leo Lainer centered from the left, the ball hit   goalie Ilias Atmatzidis' crossbar and Pfeifenberger who gained the   rebound headed it into AEK's goalmouth giving his team a 2-0 lead.   The home team went on the attack after the goals and came close to   score when Vassilis Tsartas' free kick from 25 meters (yards) hit Otto   Konrad's left upright.   The home team managed to narrow the difference in the 29th minute with   a header by Michalis Vlachos off a corner taken by Tsartas.   After the rest period, AEK continued to keep the pressure on the   Austrians to equalize, but the Austrian defense resisted well.   In one counter attack in the 76th, Croatian midfielder Mladenovic gave   a perfect pass to Ralph Hassenhuettl in AEK's area. The Austrian player   easily beat Atmatzidis to make the final 3-1.

The order from Superior Court Judge Lance Ito began a day dedicated to   the exploration of domestic violence in Simpson's relationship with   Nicole Brown Simpson. The session was considered so inflammatory the   jury was sequestered before it started.   The Sojourn shelter in Santa Monica expressed worries about the cost   and impact on the privacy of its clients of complying with the   prosecution's Dec. 29 subpoena to produce documents linked to Ms.   Simpson.   ``Sojourn is concerned that strict confidentiality be maintained,''   said shelter attorney Pamela A. Withey.   Simpson is charged with killing Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald   Goldman in June. The crime and legal proceedings have been highly   publicized in the United States.   The judge ruled that a waiver of confidentiality signed by Ms.   Simpson's father, Louis Brown, allowed for the release of the   documents. But the judge said the documents should be submitted under   seal to him first.   Ito also said the district attorney's office should reimburse Sojourn   for the cost of going through paperwork to see if anything there   pertained to Ms. Simpson. The shelter never publicly acknowledged   serving Ms. Simpson.   Ito said earlier there were ``two dozen discrete incidents or issues''   of domestic abuse to address.

       " 'training-0344': {'body': \"   South Africa's first finance minister to come from the ranks of the   governing African National Congress (ANC) is expected to balance   priorities when he presents his budget to parliament on Wednesday.   Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, who succeeded independent Chris   Liebenberg a year ago, is expected to honour a promise by President   Nelson Mandela at the recent opening of parliament that this will be   the year when previous pledges are implemented.   But he was also expected to follow the financial orthodoxy laid down by   the ANC-led government which came to power in May 1994 with the end of   the apartheid system of white minority rule.   In line with the government's reconstruction and development programme,   designed to reduce the effects of the glaring racial inequalities of   the past, more money will have to be spent on housing, health and   education in particular.   According to official sources, a total of 4.4 billion rands (990   million dollars) will be injected in these areas.   At the same time large cuts are planned in defence spending for the   second year running, as well as in a number of other public services.   But as South Africa faces a severe crime wave, the government wants to   revamp the police and justice departments before making more money   available to them.   For the new tax year beginning at the end of March economists are   forecasting expenditure of 186 billion rands (42 billion dollars) and   revenue of 163 billion rands (36.6 billion dollars).   This is in line with the four-percent deficit laid down in the   government's broad economic strategy up to the end of the century,   In a recent interview Manuel said he was confident of reaching this   target, without having recourse to the large amounts of cash coming   from the extensive privatisation programme now under way.   A general increase in the 14-percent value added tax is unlikely, amid   fears expressed by the government's trade union allies that it would   hit the poor hardest.   However a rise of the tax on cigarettes or alcohol is expected, despite   a developing black market in both products, and on motor fuel.   Manuel could also introduce a land tax and a capital gains tax, but it   is recalled that the government has had problems collecting a tax   introduced last year on interest accumulated by pension funds.   To try to increase the amount of tax collected the revenue service is   recruiting a thousand more staff and a law giving it more autonomy will   be introduced this year. Experts have commented that reform of the   service is needed.   Taxpayers meanwhile are hoping for a repetition of last year's cut in   income tax for those at the lower end of the income scale.   But companies fear that a 12.5-percent tax on dividends will be   maintained, and even that the exemption with regard to general expenses   will be abolished.   Pressure is increasing for a removal of exchange controls, but the   government has the support of the International Monetary Fund in   avoiding anything drastic.   The governor of the central bank, Chris Stals, recently suggested that   indviduals might be allowed to open accounts in foreign currency, and   that those who leave South Africa should be able to take their money   with them.   For many analysts this fiscal year will be a test of the ANC's capacity   to govern on its own, following the decision last June of the former   ruling National Party to go into opposition.   The National Party was the ANC's junior partner in a coalition   government from the start of the present dispensation in 1994, and   initially held the finance ministry.\",\n",

       " 'training-0188': {'body': '   France was bracing for an expected announcement by President Jacques   Chirac on Monday of snap legislative elections, in what could be a huge   political gamble for the Gaullist leader.   France\\'s two main televion channels said in their Sunday evening   bulletins that Chirac would appear on television the following evening   to announce the dissolution of parliament.   For the stations -- who would be charged with organising the   presidential address and who can therefore be considered well-informed   -- there was no longer any room for doubt concerning Chirac\\'s   intentions.   However, the Elysee would neither confirm nor deny the information.   Chirac, who took the weekend to weigh his decision, met with his   closest advisers Sunday evening, sources in his entourage said.   Leader of the opposition Socialist Party Lionel Jospin said that if   Chirac does call early elections it would be an \"admission of failure\"   of his government.   Jospin suggested the move might be motivated by the wish to go to the   country before potentially-damaging cases of alleged corruption hanging   over several leading figures from the ruling coalition can be brought   to court.   Speculation that the elections would be brought forward from their   original date of March next year has had Paris political circles in a   frenzy for the past two weeks.   The two-round elections, which must happen between 20-40 days after the   formal dissolution decree is signed, are thought most likely to be   scheduled for June 1 and 8.   Premier Alain Juppe said he was \"ready\" for ballots whenever they come,   according to the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper.   \"A politician must always be ready,\" he was quoted by the paper as   saying.   French markets dropped sharply at the end of last week, and more   turmoil is expected if Chirac confirms the decision Monday night.   The main reason for an early dissolution is widely agreed to be Europe   union. If elections were held early next year, they would come barely a   month before the final deadline on countries to enter the first wave of   the planned European single currency, the euro.   Government officials fear the elections then would become a referendum   on the euro, an issue on which the French remain divided despite the   apparent consensus among political leaders.   Chirac, who has plumbed depths of unpopularity since taking power in   May 1995, is also seen keen to \"relaunch\" his ailing government, in   theory to give him parliamentary support through the end of his   seven-year mandate in 2002.   Analysts point out that the ruling centre-right coalition, which routed   the left in 1993 elections, cannot hope to retain its 80 percent   majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, but may consider it will   lose fewer seats now than later.   But the gamble involved in snap ballots was underlined Sunday by a new   poll suggesting that French voters may be ready to express their   frustrations at Juppe\\'s and Chirac\\'s austerity policies in the ballot   box.   The survey by the IFOP polling institute showed support for both Chirac   and Juppe dropping again to 31 and 27 percent respectively, echoing   recent polls suggesting that a socialist-communist alliance could even   seize a majority.   In that case Chirac, far from relaunching his government for the next   five years, would be forced into \"cohabitation\" with a leftwing prime   minister, most likely to be Jospin.   Jospin, who put up a strong fight against Chirac in the 1995   presidential polls, said in a TV interview Sunday night that the left   could unite to win.   \"I think we can come together around this campaign,\" he said, referring   to his party and communists putting aside their differences, notably   over Europe, to fight the ruling centre-right bloc.   He dismissed the argument that early elections were needed to avoid a   clash of interests next year with the timetable for European monetary   union, saying the motives were more cynical.   \"The economic situation is going to get worse, with unemployment and   deficits, they\\'re trying to make the French vote before the situation   gets worse,\" he said.',\n",

Reminding the meeting of the fact that it has cost the developing   countries heavily to host and protect the majority of refugees for many   years, Qiao said that the developed countries should provide assistance   actively, avoid the adoption of highly restrictive asylum policies and   shoulder their responsibilities to accept more refugees for   resettlement.   \"As a country of asylum, China fulfills its international obligation   and has provided effective protection for 280,000 Indo- Chinese   refugees over the past 20 years with its limited resources, \" Qiao told   the meeting.

People gathering to watch American soldiers arrive at this capital's   harbor and airport were driven away by baton-wielding police and   Haitian soldiers. In some areas, U.S. servicemen watched from their   posts.   Many Haitians said they were disappointed that the U.S. military was   not coming to their aid.   ``These people are talking about (exiled President Jean-Bertrand)   Aristide coming back. That's the only reason they are being beaten,''   said Frantz Merilus, who watched police chase and beat people at the   harborside. ``I think these Aristide supporters thought the Americans   would protect them.''   As pockets of onlookers grew into large crowds during the past two   days, watching sometimes transformed into demonstrating. For the first   time in three years, people openly showed their support for Aristide.   Their enthusiasm was greeted by repression.   ``Our police and army still terrorize the people,'' said Claude Dutrie,   who said he was an unemployed artist. ``We thought we would be free to   express our joy now that (military leader Lt.

Cedras is expected to leave office by Oct. 15, sooner if the Haitian   parliament adopts a measure granting him amnesty, according to an   agreement forged by former President Jimmy Carter.   There were reports the people taunted and threw stones at police and   Haitian soldiers Tuesday morning in the streets. No stone-throwing was   evident in the afternoon, though soldiers continued the crackdown.   People ran from a busload of Haitian soldiers. One youth, clutching his   arm, cried bitterly as he ducked through a hole in a chain-link fence.   Police sporadically chased people. A burly police sergeant paused at   one point to buy a cup of flavored shaved ice from a street vendor.   ``This is madness,'' said Dutrie. ``There is no reason for such   violence.''   Michael Stenis, who watched from a distance, suggested that the   presence of American troops was influencing the street scene.   ``If the Americans were not here, a lot of these people would be   shot,'' he said.   In the late afternoon, a pair of blue sandals rested in the middle of   the street -- someone literally chased out of there shoes.\",\n",

       " 'training-0180': {'body': \"   If you want a multimillion-dollar advance from a big publishing house,   like the one House Speaker Newt Gingrich negotiated and then gave up,   you had best be:   (a) Tom Clancy, Mary Higgins Clark, Danielle Steele or some other   bestselling author with a track record.   (b) An otherwise famous person at the peak of notoriety.   A hot author or a hot name is akin to a hot athlete in the free-agent   market, says Wendy Nicholson, vice president of Simon &AMP; Schuster   publishing house in New York.   ``What you find is more than one publisher bidding for a book, and that   of course drives up the price,'' she said.   Gingrich's deal, which initially called for a $4.5 million advance,   raised eyebrows in the political world. It also drew attention to the   publishing world, where million-dollar advances are rare but not   unheard of.   Former President Ronald Reagan reportedly got $7 million for his   memoirs, and   Army Gens. Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell drew $6 million apiece   for their tomes. Powell's has not yet been published.   An advance represents a gamble by a publisher on sales of the book.   Technically, it's just a prepayment of royalties, the percentage from   sales that authors get.   In Gingrich's case, for instance, his book would need to generate at   least $30 million in revenues to ``repay'' the advance if the royalty   rate was 15 percent of sales. That means that if the book costs less   than $30 a copy, more than a million must be sold.   But authors are rarely required to repay the advance if a book doesn't   sell up to its pre-publication expectations.   In Reagan's case, for one, the advance didn't pay off. The former   president's ``An American Life'' sold only about 200,000 copies,   carrying on a generally lackluster tradition for presidential memoirs.   Republican Gingrich's advance was criticized by Democratic foes in   Congress and others who questioned its size and whether Gingrich had a   conflict of interest in accepting it from the HarperCollins publishing   house.   Much of the criticism focused on a meeting that Gingrich had with media   mogul Rupert Murdoch before signing the deal. Murdoch's holdings   include HarperCollins. He is expected to have dealings with the federal   government in the next year, particularly over his broadcast   properties.   Bowing somewhat to the criticism, Gingrich agreed to forgo the advance   in favor of simply taking royalties later. As a result, he will begin   receiving payments when the first book sells. And, of course, all the   pre-publication publicity is not likely to hurt book sales.   If the book hits it big, Gingrich will be in varied company.   William Bennett, a member of Reagan's Cabinet, didn't get the same   advance that his former boss did; publishing sources say Bennett's was   well under $1 million. But his ``Book of Virtues'' was far more popular   than Reagan's book, selling more than a million copies.   As impressive as was Bennett's ``Virtues,'' the lack of same apparently   can also pay off.   In 1992, Warner Books ordered an initial printing of 29,000 for a   first-time romance novel by an obscure Iowa college professer, Robert   James Waller. Waller had knocked off ``Bridges of Madison County,'' a   story about a tryst in rural Iowa, in 14 days. Warner won't say whether   it gave Waller an advance, but industry sources say it's unlikely that   he received one as a first-time author.   Through the end of 1994, Bridges had sold 7 million copies, been   translated into 23 languages and been transformed into a film starring   Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. So strong was the book's power that a   parody sold 100,000 copies.   Even if Waller didn't get a big advance for his ``Bridges'' (although   he probably will receive hefty advances for subsequent works), he did   well. Industry sources say that royalties of 10 percent to 15 percent   are standard, meaning that the professor probably pocketed almost $2   million for his 171-page work, even before the Hollywood money started   coming in.   ``The advances run all over the board,'' said Nicholson of Simon &AMP;   Schuster. ``But the royalty figures are pretty standard at between 10   percent and 15 percent, generally on a sliding scale as book sales   rise.''   Political books, as Reagan's experience attests, are not considered hot   properties in the publishing business. But Hillary Rodham Clinton might   want to take heed: Nicholson notes that former first lady Barbara Bush   landed on the No. 1 position on the bestseller list with her memoir.   ``Generally,'' she said, ``president's wives sell better than the   ex-presidents.''\",\n",

The two-day meeting is the first in a series of ministerial meetings   that Canada will chair to advance preparations for the APEC Leaders\\'   Meeting in November.   A number of sectors that might be candidates for early voluntary   liberalization have been discussed, according to the statement of the   chair.   \"Ministers agreed to direct officials to examine the merits of pursuing   comprehensive liberalization in such sectors having regard to defining   scope and coverage, including those that support enhanced   infrastructure and sustainable development,\" the statement said.   These officials will complete their study by the end of August and   report to the ministers in time so as to let them make recommendations   on specific liberalization initiatives to the leaders in Vancouver in   November.   On Individual Action Plans (IAP), the ministers agreed that IAP are key   to the implementation of APEC\\'s trade agenda. They will provide reports   by August 15 on actions taken to implement commitments for 1997.   They \"agreed to commit to the importance of taking IAP forward   progressively and continuously, with effective means to assess and   review them over time,\" the statement said.   The ministers reviewed key APEC activities designed to facilitate trade   and lower the costs of doing business, and emphasized the importance of   intensifying efforts in simplifying customs procedures and enhancing   investment environment.   On engaging business and the broader community, the ministers   reaffirmed \"the central role of the business sector\" and determined to   encourage greater business sector participation in liberalization and   facilitation of trade and in economic and technical cooperation.   The ministers also exchanged views with World Trade Organization (WTO)   director general Renatto Ruggiero on how APEC can best support the   multilateral trading system.   \"Ministers affirmed their strong support for a rules-based   international trading system of universal membership, and confirmed   their support for the early accession of applicants in accordance with   WTO rules, based on effective market access commitments,\" the statement   said.

However, wholesale imports of vegetable and food from China were still   arriving in Macau through official channels, she said.   \"Normal imports of daily supplies of meat and seafood have not been   affected.

There are small, but relatively significant, amounts of food that are   brought in by Macau individuals, who benefit from a big price   difference between China and Macau, she explained.   Ho declined to make any link between the ban and the cyanide incident   and insisted, \"there is no scare in the territory.\"   Over 80 drums, each containing 50 kilogrammes (110 pounds) of sodium   cyanide, fell from a truck Tuesday into the Guijiang river, which   eventually flows into the heavily populated Pearl River Delta.

Chinese authorities Thursday said all the barrels had been recovered   and tests showed there was not a dangerous level of the chemical in the   river or drinking water.

The greenback's recovery began overnight as the German mark weakened,   after German monetary officials alluded to a possible relaxation in   monetary policy, Renfer said.

The enquiry, originally set up under Judge James Wood to investigate   corruption in the New South Wales police force, last year turned its   focus onto allegations of police protection of paedophile networks.   It found evidence of widespread and sometimes organised paedophilia in   schools and welfare departments and confirmed that corruption in the   police service was endemic.   Evidence, sometimes on videotape, was presented of officers dealing   drugs in nightclubs, buying child pornography and snorting cocaine with   prostitutes.   Scores of officers have quit or been sacked or suspended pending   prosecution which is expected to begin now the commission has finished.   Of the many scalps the enquiry claimed, the most recent was the elite   police Special Branch, which was disbanded Wednesday following evidence   of gross impropriety.   Perhaps its most disturbing chapter was the suicide of former Supreme   Court judge David Yeldham last November, hours after admitting to   investigators he had been questioned by police about indecent behaviour   in the toilets of a railway station.   A Special Branch officer told the commission this week that some of his   colleagues had protected Yeldham from prosecution for indecency, with   the inference that police received favourable judgements in return.   Royal Commissioner James Wood's final report into police corruption is   to be given to the New South Wales state government at the end of   April. His second report, into paedophiles, will be with government by   June 30.   It is believed to be among the most costly and longest-running royal   commissions in Australian history.\",\n",

Redrawing of the political map, the public's thirst for change and a   high number of open seats combined to boost Hispanic membership in the   House of Representatives from 11 to a record 17 in 1992. The jump gave   the nation's second largest minority a stronger voice on national   issues.   Hispanics are still underrepresented in Congress compared to their   percentage of the population. They number 22.4 million, or about 9   percent of the U.S. population, but they hold only 4 percent of House   seats. There are no Hispanics in the U.S. Senate.   Redistricting after the 1990 Census created a record 20   Hispanic-majority congressional districts. Political observers say that   is probably the best showing Hispanic candidates will enjoy for years.   ``The redistricting really created contests where Hispanics had a good   chance of winning,'' said Robert Brischetto, executive director of the   Southwest Voter Research Institute, which studies Hispanic voting   trends. ``Now the question is trying to protect these incumbents.''   Despite the public's dissatisfaction with incumbents, particularly   Democrats, this year, analysts expect most Hispanics in Congress to be   re-elected.   All but three Hispanic lawmakers are Democrats and all but two   represent majority-Hispanic districts. Traditionally, 80 percent of   Mexican Americans have voted for Democrats, and most people favor   candidates of the same ethnic background, said Mark Brimhall, a   researcher for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed   Officials.   ``The mid-term elections are never a strength for anyone,'' Brimhall   said. ``We don't expect any real gains, but we expect a lot of   incumbents to do very well.''   The most-endangered Hispanic incumbent is Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San   Antonio, the first Mexican-American Republican elected to the House.   Bonilla's race has attracted publicity, however, because his   challenger, Democrat Rolando Rios, also is Hispanic.   In addition to the incumbents, 12 Hispanics are running for House seats   in one of the two major parties, according to NALEO. Also, Republican   Bernadette Castro is challenging Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,   but she is not expected to win. Only two Hispanics have ever served in   the Senate.   All but two of the Hispanic challengers are Republicans, a sign that   the GOP is recognizing the value of Hispanic candidates and the   community's needs, Brischetto said.   ``Republicans have wised up to the fact that they can cut a piece off   the traditional Democratic voting bloc,'' Brischetto said. ``That's why   they've been running Hispanics and been willing to put money behind   them.''   At the state and local level, the number of Hispanic elected officials   is expected to rise between 3 and 5 percent, said Harry Pachon,   director of the Tomas Rivera Center in Claremont, Calif. There are   about 5,000 Hispanic elected officials nationwide.   These candidates are gaining the experience they need to move up to   national office in the coming years, Pachon said, adding that term   limit initiatives in many states are opening opportunities for   Hispanics and other candidates without legislative experience.   Pachon predicted Hispanics will make gains in coming years and approach   true representation. A recent Census Bureau study projected that   Hispanics will become the nation's largest minority by the year 2010,   when their population is expected to top 40 million.   ``The community has some distance to go for real empowerment,'' Pachon   said.\",\n",

Israel's fears of terrorism were underlined by a controversial   decision to station dogs at West Bank crossings. The Cabinet extended the   closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip for at least another week, saying   it would be removed only if the Palestinian Authority took steps against   Islamic militants. The Cabinet approved the closure last week in response   to attacks that have killed 54 people since Oct. 1. PARIS -- Rivers in   western Europe rose to near or above record levels Sunday, driving hundreds   more people from their homes and shutting down factories.

Heavy flooding also has hit the Netherlands. A new storm, another of   a chain that has rolled in from the Atlantic in recent days, brought light   showers Sunday and many rivers were reported leveling off. But rougher   weather was predicted for Wednesday.\",\n",

       " 'training-0968': {'body': '   For a man with the guillotine hovering perilously over his neck as he   focuses on South Africa, Mark Taylor remains remarkably relaxed.   The Australian captain was still able to smile broadly Tuesday as he   analysed his nightmare run with the bat in the Test series against the   West Indies.   The series ended here Monday with a runaway 10-wicket win for Courtney   Walsh\\'s side, though Australia won the series 3-2.   \"I am out of form -- there is no doubt about that,\" he conceded, with   characteristic candour.   \"I am not going to kid myself to say I am hitting them well and I am   just getting out. That would be foolhardy.   \"I have to play better. I have to improve.\"   Taylor faces a problem approaching crisis proportions, compounded by   Australia\\'s imminent departure for South Africa, where the tourists   will rely heavily on solid starts by their opening batsmen -- Taylor,   Matthew Hayden and Matthew Elliott -- against South Africa\\'s menacing   pace.   The Australians fly to South Africa later this week and play in three   Tests which, arguably, will decide the unofficial world Test   championship.   The left-handed Taylor had a Test average of almost 46 before this   summer, yet in nine innings in the five Tests against the West Indies   he has struggled to make 153 runs at a meagre average of 17.   He has only one half century to his name in his past 25 first-class   knocks.   His form in one-day internationals this summer was equally poor, with   eight knocks yielding 143 runs for an average of 17.87.   During a period in which Australia\\'s selectors have been notoriously   unsympathetic to failure, 32-year-old Taylor -- a veteran of 77 Tests   in which he has notched up 14 centuries -- has survived because of his   outstanding captaincy flair.   The Australian psyche is intolerant of consistently non-producing   captains, however special their strategic talents, and Taylor must now   be desperately close to the brink after his recent loss of form.   \"A lot of it is in the mind, but I think you can overcome that by   getting other things moving,\" Taylor said.   \"If you work on the physical side, the mental side comes with it.\"   Taylor said he was looking forward to arriving in South Africa, where   he could escape from the extra pressures of being a captain in a home   series.   \"I hope to spend the first three weeks of the tour working on just Mark   Taylor for a while, and hopefully I can turn it around,\" he said.   Taylor, like many top batsmen before him, lamented that players having   bad trots appear to be dealt a cruel hand by chance.   \"It\\'s amazing how when you are out of form, you get good balls, you get   run out -- these things happen,\" he said.   \"And when you are in form, you play and miss -- blokes throw to the   wrong end when they are trying to run you out.\"   Asked bluntly how many more low scores he could afford before he got   the axe, Taylor replied curtly: \"Ask the selectors, mate. They pick the   side, not me.\"   Taylor can gain little comfort from his last visit to South Africa   three years ago when he was vice-captain to Allan Border for the   three-Test series, which was drawn 1-1.   He was the least successful of Australia\\'s specialist batsmen,   totalling only 97 runs from four innings in two Tests to average 24.25.   He must do considerably better than that this time to guarantee his   retention at the helm for the Ashes tour of England shortly after.',\n",

Salim, who was appointed as ambassador from the age of 22, said he   would also like to share his experience with Tanzanians and Africans   after retirement.   \"What I would really like to do, if circumstances allow, would be to go   from one African country to another to talk to the future leaders of   this continent, the young people of this continent,\" he said.

Addressing newsmen here at the end of his three-day state visit to   Tanzania, Mandela said he and Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi had   agreed to explore cooperation in the fields of trade, agriculture and   mining for mutual benefit of their two countries.   Mandela said before departure for home that he will instruct his trade   minister Trevor Manuel to work out a scheme in which Tanzania can   benefit from South Africa\\'s vast experience.   \"We will give Tanzania a special consideration in sharing our economic   advantage as a tribute to its sacrifice in the liberation of struggle   of the continent, and South Africa in particular,\" Mandela declared.   He said his country is committed to helping Tanzania, and requested   Tanzanian government to state priority areas that needed South African   assistance.   \"To avoid South Africa becoming an overpowering partner in economic   cooperation between our two countries, Tanzania should pinpoint areas   which will bear fruits to both sides in a two-way traffic cooperation,\"   Mandela stressed.

In an unusual move, the three former presidents, together with eight   former secretaries of state, five former secretaries of treasury, six   former secretaries of defense and five former national security   advisors, signed an open letter to the Congress, urging the legislators   to approve the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) status for China.   \"American foreign policy cannot succeed if it fails to engage China,\"   said the letter, which was published Wednesday in The Washington Post,   The New York Times and other influential newspapers.   \"Establishing strong, enduring ties with China has been a principal   objective of American foreign policy since President (Richard) Nixon\\'s   historic visit in 1972, and has been supported by all subsequent   administrations of both parties,\" the letter read.   \"President Clinton\\'s upcoming visit to the People\\'s Republic of China   is a continuation of that policy. It is also an affirmation of the   importance of constructive Sino-American relations at a critical moment   in Asia,\" the letter said.   \"It is thus necessary that the visit take place as scheduled,\" it   added.   Some lawmakers, alleging China of human rights violations and accusing   the administration of transferring high-techs to the country, asked   Clinton to postpone or even cancel the trip, which would be the first   presidential visit to China in a decade.   Last week, in a major speech on his China policy, Clinton also defended   his trip by emphasizing that engagement with China is in the interest   of the U.S. while isolation will make the U.S. itself isolated.   \"The importance of the strategic relationship is underscored by current   developments in the region, particularly Asian financial crisis and the   nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. It is likewise in the vital   interest of the United States that China continue to open and reform   its economy and improve the quality of life of its citizens,\" the   letter said.   \"We can advance that vital interest by continuing to extend normal   trading relations to China,\" it added.   Clinton decided early this month to extend the MFN trade status to   China for another year. However, the Congress has a right to debate and   vote on the decision within a month while some lawmakers oppose it.   \"The price for a failure to forge a strong, consistent policy towards   China will be paid in a weakened American ability to shape   international events in ways that serve our interests and support our   values,\" the letter said.   \"China is destined to become a great economic and political power in   the 21st century. The United States should neither fear nor oppose this   development,\" the letter said.   \"U.S. policy should instead proceed from the premise that our vital   national security interests are best served by a China that appreciates   America\\'s basic values and becomes a full participantt in the   international system and institutions which the United States has taken   the lead in creating since 1945,\" it said.   \"Leadership, engagement and commitment on our part are essential to   helping China assume such a role,\" the letter said.',\n",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not even OK plans for an   anti-missile, anti-Russia missile shield in Europe.   The NATO summit didn\\'t even express confidence in its mission in   Afghanistan.   \"NATO thugs are busy bombing the hell out of Afghanistan to make that   Bush-monkey happy and to help grab oil in Central Asia and pressure   Russia,\" one NATO official confidentially snorted. \"Jesus this Afghan   smack is good stuff!\"   NATO has about 47,000 troops in Afghanistan, but gutless commanders   particularly from Canada are begging for more troops in the south,   where Taliban insurgents are winning the war. The US has about 14,000   troops for NATO there, plus another 13,000 stomping the Afghans in   eastern Afghanistan.   Bush said Russia should not fear NATO, but rather should welcome the   alliance because it \"is a group of nations dedicated to warmongering   and propping up the dying US empire by whatever means and buying our   crappy overpriced weapons with sinking US dollars.\"   Special NATO guest Ron Paul then spoke, saying, \"I rise in opposition   to the further expansion of NATO to the borders of Russia. NATO is an   organization whose purpose ended with the end of its Warsaw Pact   adversary. When NATO struggled to define its future after the Cold War,   it settled on attacking an innocent sovereign state, Yugoslavia, which   had neither invaded nor threatened any NATO member state.\"   \"This current round of NATO expansion is a political reward to   governments in Georgia and Ukraine that came to power as a result of   US-supported revolutions, the so-called Orange Revolution and Rose   Revolution,\" Paul continued. \"The governments that arose from these   street protests were eager to please their US sponsor and the US, in   turn, turned a blind eye to the numerous political and human rights   abuses that took place under the new regimes. Thus the US policy of   \"exporting democracy\" has only succeeding in exporting more misery to   the countries it has targeted.\"   Paul said, \"NATO expansion only benefits the US military industrial   complex, which stands to profit from expanded arms sales to new NATO   members. The \"modernization\" of former Soviet militaries in Ukraine and   Georgia will mean tens of millions in sales to US and European military   contractors. The US taxpayer will be left holding the bill, as the US   government will subsidize most of the transactions.\"   As NATO officials fell asleep, Paul shouted, \"Providing US military   guarantees to Ukraine and Georgia can only further strain our military.   This NATO expansion may well involve the US military in conflicts as   unrelated to our national interest as the breakaway regions of South   Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia. The idea that American troops might be   forced to fight and die to prevent a small section of Georgia from   seceding is absurd and disturbing.\"   \"NATO should thus be disbanded, not expanded,\" Paul concluded.

The latest deaths included two people killed in their beds by unknown   attackers near Donneybrook, Naidoo said.   The rural community south of here has been a hotbed of political   violence recently that has continued unabated despite a peace   initiative last month by the province's two rival political groups,   Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and Mangosuthu   Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).   In all, close to 20,000 people have died -- 1,800 since January --   during an 11-year struggle for power in KwaZulu-Natal between the ANC   and IFP.   Most of South Africa voted for local government councils last November,   with parts of the Western Cape going to the polls in May.   Voting in KwaZulu-Natal, however, was postponed twice because of   political disputes and the ongoing violence.   The poll is seen as the first major popularity test for the IFP that   rules KwaZulu-Natal's provincial government -- which will not be   affected by next week's election -- since South Africa's first   democratic elections in 1994.\",\n",

Moody\\'s said the financial strength ratings were at the low end of the   scale, but excluded Nippon Trust Bank Ltd., which had an \"E-plus\"   rating, because of explicit support from parent Bank of   Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.

But it said \"nonperforming loans continue to remain on the trust banks\\'   balance sheets, and trust sales of real estate collateral continue to   be difficult and time consuming.\"   The finance ministry has reported that the seven trust banks held 6,015   billion yen worth bad loans at the end of March.   Moody\\'s said the trust banks were experiencing substantial pressure on   their capital and the true magnitude of the problem was yet to be   reflected in official statistics on nonperforming loans.   The banks were also facing growing competitive pressure from city banks   and securities companies as they enter the trust banking market.   Moody\\'s said the trust banks continued to depend on the wholesale   lending market, but the favourable impact of low interest rates will   disappear, while opportunities for lending growth are limited due to   the depressed real estate market.',\n",

News of the incident   was not released until Tuesday, when her lawyer, Bara Diokhane, issued   a public statement proclaiming her innocence.   According to police and Diokhane, the model was a passenger in a car   that was pulled over by drug agents during a Dec. 20-21 sweep in which   18 other people were arrested.

Berlusconi, who is leader of one of Italy\\'s leading rightwing parties   Forza Italia, has said he would withdraw from political life if it were   proved he had been lying when he claimed he had played no part in the   alleged transactions.   The officials said the request to an examining magistrate here followed   an investigation into foreign bank accounts of the Socialist Party   (PSI) which allegedly received non-authorised payments to then party   chief Craxi.   Some of the payments allegedly came from Berlusconi\\'s company   Fininvest. Craxi, who was a close friend of Berlusconi and was prime   minister between 1983 and 1987, has been in self-imposed exile for more   than two years in Tunisia.   Craxi was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in October on   corruption charges.   The request, which also applies to another 19 people, who are alleged   associates of Berlusconi and Craxi, comes from the pool of Milan \"Clean   Hands\" prosecutors which has been investigating corruption in Italian   political life, and will be considered by a preliminary hearing.   Speaking in Rome at the end of November, Berlusconi, said: \"I always   made a very clear distinction between family, business and politics.   \"I am ready to withdraw from politics if evidence is found to the   contrary, and I defy anyone to prove that I could have industrial,   commercial or financial activities with the political parties, notably   with the Socialist party and its secretary,\" he said.   On November 23, the Milan court also issued an arrest warrant against   Giorgio Vanoni, in charge of external relations at Fininvest.   Vanoni, who is suspected of handing some 10 billion lire (6.2 million   dollars) to Bettino Craxi in 1991, gave himself up to the police   earlier this year.   Berlusconi has always maintained that the 10 billion lire payment was   totally above board and was to cover the cinema and television rights   to a company belonging to Tunisian producer Tarek Ben Hammar, who lives   in France.   Ben Hammar supported Berlusconi\\'s version of events, and specified that   he had asked Fininvest to pay the money into the bank account of an   Arab lawyer to whom he owed money. He claimed he knew nothing about the   ultimate destination of the payment.   Berlusconi, 59, who was prime minister from May 1994 until January last   year, is already being tried for corruption and is the target of   several other investigations.   Together with his brother Paolo, Fininvest finance director Salvatore   Sciascia, and seven other people, Berlusconi is accused of authorising   the illegal payment of some 380 million lire (nearly 240,000 dollars)   to tax inspectors between 1989 and early 1994, to avoid tax   inspections.

       " 'training-2465': {'body': '   The rump Yugoslav state and Croatia pressed ahead Wednesday with   last-minute negotiations to meet a deadline for bilateral recognition   by the end of the week.   Territorial and money questions lie at the heart of most of the   outstanding problems.   Yugoslavia, now consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia, a now   independent former part of the old Yugoslav state, are at odds over a   strip of land on the Adriatic Sea and the problem of how to divide up   property inherited from the former Yugoslav confederation from which   they emerged.   Croatian foreign ministry sources said of the talks: \"We\\'re on the last   stretch. They are at a stage where they can only fail or succeed   completely.\"   The territorial problem concerns Prevlaka, a Croatian peninsula that   borders on Montenegro and is claimed by Yugoslavia for security reasons   because it dominates an important Yugoslav naval base in Montenegro.   Prevlaka is currently occupied by UN observers.   Croatia has agreed to treat the Prevlaka problem as a security one, and   has proposed a special dimilitarised status for the peninsula.   The source told AFP: \"This is the last limit to which we will go.\"   He said Belgrade\\'s proposals of territorial exchanges between   Yugoslavia, Croatia and the Republika Srpska -- the Bosnian Serb entity   in Bosnia -- were not acceptable to Croatia.   As far as the division of property from the former state was concerned,   Croatia was seeking to include wording in the recognition treaty which   would acknowledge Croatian national and historic continuity.   Such a formula, sources said, would eliminate Belgrade\\'s accusation   that Croatia had seceded from the former Yugoslav state.   This accusation had in turn been interfering with Croatian claims to   property dating from the former Confederation, the source stressed.   Humanitarian problems of missing persons and the return of refugees are   also dogging negotiations. But the Zagreb government says a favourable   settlement can be reached.   Croatia declared its independence from former Yugolsavia in late June   1991 and bitter fighting developed between it and rump Yuogslavia until   the early days of the following year.   The Zagreb news agency Hina reported that Croatian and Yugoslav expert   commisssions had agreed to proceed by September 15 at the latest to a   final exchange of information on the fate of missing persons during the   conflict.   President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and and Serbian President Slobodan   Milosevic agreed on August 7 at a summit near Athens on the principle   of normalisation of relations.   The two states are the last of those to emerge from the former Yuogslav   Confederation not to have recognised each other bilaterally.   Tudjman put forward August 23 -- this Friday -- as the deadline for   signature of an accord, but Belgrade has not confirmed this date.   Croatian government sources here said a planned visit this coming   Friday by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic to sign an accord   depended entirely on the success of current negotiations.',\n",

The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that sales climbed a   strong 1 percent in November after advancing 0.3 percent in October.   Analysts expected the November inventory gain, given last year's robust   buying pace. But they said leaner stockpiles may be ahead if consumer   spending slows.   Last week, the government said retail sales -- about a third of all   sales -- declined 0.1 percent in December in what analysts said could   be a sign the spending spree that has driven the four-year economic   expansion is easing.   The Commerce Department said Wednesday inventories totaled a seasonally   adjusted dlrs 919.8 billion in November, up from dlrs 913.4 billion.   Inventories in November were 6.2 percent higher than a year earlier.   The 0.7 percent increase in inventories in October was revised upward   from an earlier 0.4 percent estimate.   Stockpiles have now risen in 10 of the last 11 months, slipping in   March by 0.2 percent for their only decline.   The inventory buildup in November was led by big-ticket durable goods,   which increased 0.8 percent from October and were 7.9 percent higher   than a year earlier.   Sales in November were at a seasonally adjusted dlrs 658.4 billion, up   from dlrs 651.9 billion. They were 8.5 percent higher than a year   earlier.   The inventory-to-sales ratio remained at 1.40 -- barely up from its   historic low of 1.39 in August. That means it would take 1.40 months to   exhaust stockpiles at the November sales rate.   The ratio is normally a sign of economic strength, since any growth in   sales likely would lead to new orders to replenish shelves and   backlots.   Because of the strength in sales last year, inventories have stayed at   historically low levels even as they have accumulated rapidly.   Retail inventories rose to dlrs 294.7 billion in November from dlrs   293.1 billion. Stockpiles at the wholesale level were up to dlrs 235.1   billion from dlrs 232.2 billion.

Drug dealers secretly smuggle and traffick in drugs mostly from the   port city of Mombasa as the Anti-Narcotics Unit has taken stringent   measures at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.   In Nairobi, heroin is easier available than cocaine since the former is   easily trafficked from India and Pakistan while the latter is sourced   from far-away South America.   Residents are quoted as saying that drug dealers are influential   individuals who operate under the police protection.   The paper quoted Head of Anti-Narcotics Unit Michael Jackoham as   confirming the activities of the drug syndicate.   He said, \"the drug problem in Kenya, especially in urban centers, is   serious and should be addressed now.\"',\n",

       " 'training-1813': {'body': \"   The Pentagon has commissioned scientists around the country to train   bees to sniff out traces of explosives in the hope one day they will be   able to track bomb ingredients to a source, The New York Times said   Monday.   The research, begun three years ago, is still in its initial stage, but   has progressed from using bees to clear minefields to training bees to   pick out a truck tainted with explosives.   The bees' bomb sniffing ability, reported the Air Force Research   Laboratory in Texas, is accurate more than 99 percent of the time,   according recent tests.   The next step for the Air Force team is to equip bees with rice   grain-size transmitters that would allow them to be tracked as they   follow trails of bomb ingredients to a source, the daily said.   University of Montana researchers said they use sugar as a reward to   train the bees to abandon flower scents for dynamite or other   explosives.   Pentagon officials admit that bomb-sniffing bees may draw a smile from   the public, but say they hold great potential.   They said trained bees in future could be placed in hives near   important security checkpoints to screen for potential terrorists.   More in the future, is the possibility that bees' ultra sensitive hairs   could be used to screen the air for biological and chemical weapons.   Researchers said early tests show that bees are efficient sampling   mechanisms for airborne bacterial spores.   Since 1998, the Pentagon has spent 25 million dollars on researching   bees and other so-called controlled biological systems -- animal traits   that could be turned into war-fighting technologies, the daily said.\",\n",

Telkom, which provides domestic and international communication   services, would replace the B2R with either another B generation   satellite or one of the yet to be produced D series models.   The final decision would be made by the government, Telkom's biggest   shareholder, a company spokesman said.   Four foreign companies -- Hughes and Lockheed of the United States and   Aerospatial and Marconi Matra from Europe -- are contending for the new   satellite contract, Nasution said.   US-based Hughes Space and Communication Corporation has manufactured   all of Indonesia's Palapa satellites. The satellites have a combined   footprint covering most of southeast Asia and carry general   telecommunications, as well as Indonesian and foreign television   broadcasts.   Telkom officials earlier said the D series would replace B generation   models as they came out of service.

Israel will complete the contract as scheduled, Leoro said, disputing   reports that it would delay the delivery of the modified KFir warplanes   because of concern the military acquisition could complicate peace   negotiations between Ecuador and Peru.   The foreign minister declined to comment on those reports out of Tel   Aviv.   \"What is certain is that the contract will be completed, because there   is nothing in it that will influence the military balance between the   two countries,\" he added.   In early January, the US embassy here denied a report that the United   States, reversing an earlier decision, had vetoed the Israeli jet sale   to Ecuador.   Under US law covering military exports, Israel must seek authorization   to export the Kfir fighters because they are built with US-made   engines.   Washington\\'s approval of the sale prompted angry protests from   neighboring Peru.   Ecuador and Peru fought a border war last year. The United States is   one of the four guarantors of the peace treaty that ended the fighting.',\n",

       " 'training-0504': {'body': '   A signed article on Sunday\\'s Business Weekly urged the Government to   enhance supervision over foreign financial sectors in China but lower   restrictions on the entry of overseas banks.   Mu Yibin, holder of doctorate from the Graduate School of the People\\'s   Bank of China, said in the article that China should enhance   supervision over the financial sector in the light of the Asian   financial turmoil.   Due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the total assets,   outstanding loans and capital inflows of foreign banking organizations   located in China declined in 1998 for the first time since the country   opened its door to foreign banks in the early 1980s.   The article said that the fallout from the crisis requires Chin a\\'s   financial supervision authorities to keep a closer eye on the risks   lurking in these foreign banking organizations, especially those from   the worst-affected countries.   Some wholly-owned foreign banks and joint-venture banks should be urged   to improve their internal management systems since they are at greater   risk due to their small size and limited capital resources.   In addition, the article said that China should accelerate the   financial opening-up drive and continue to foster an upbeat environment   for foreign investors in 1999, and that the central bank could consider   canceling the restrictions on the location of foreign banks\\' outlets in   China.   The article also suggested the central bank consider lowering the   threshold for the entry of foreign banks\\' representative offices, since   most countries place few restrictions on the entry of representative   offices of overseas banks.   \"It would be better to concentrate on stricter supervision rather than   tough entry requirements,\" said the article.   Currently, a total of 23 cities and one province are open to foreign   banks. By June 1997, there were 540 foreign financial institutions in   China, including banks, insurance companies, branches of banks, finance   companies and investment banks.',\n",

       " 'training-0509': {'body': '   In response to sagging television ratings and decreased interest, the   International Olympic Committee has decided to allow athletes the use   of performance-enhancing drugs and has abandoned all urine and blood   analysis.   \"We had dismal ratings for the Winter Olympics this years\", Olympic   Committee spokesperson Jason Felder said at a news conference. \"We   would have a much greater viewership if the Games were more exciting.   We will not make the same mistake for the Summer Games.\"   Most of the athletes expressed enthusiasm at the Committee\\'s decision.   \"We\\'ve been doping up for years anyway\", said speed skater Tonya   Michaels, \"Just now we won\\'t have to hide it. You don\\'t think I got   these powerful thighs and tight ass from exercise alone, do you?\"   US Super-Heavyweight weightlifter Todd Rogers expressed relief at the   decision. \"I was so afraid I was gonna get caught this time\", he   remarked. \"Now I can take my medications\\' without fear of being tossed   off the team\".   International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said that he   was sick and tired of perfectly good athletes being ousted from the   Games for taking cold medications or attempting to better themselves in   any way possible. \"We now encourage athletes to do whatever it takes to   be the best they can be\", he said. \"With this long-overdue decision   form the Committee we will now see records broken like never before.   Runners will run faster. Weightlifters will be lifting twice what they   could before. Gymnasts will be able to perform acrobatics that the   world has never seen! I anticipate the entire world will be watching   the Games this year without exception. Advertising revenues will go   through the roof!\"   A very small percentage of athletes did not welcome the news so   quickly. \"I\\'m allergic to some of those drugs\", said African marathon   runner Xula Kinte. \"I am #1 in the world but I won\\'t stand a chance   this time\".   After this interview Kinte was assured by doctors that hypo-allergenic   performance enhancing drugs were now available and he was noticeably   relieved. \"Olympics move you ass here I come!\" Kinte exclaimed   excitedly.   Olympic financial spokesperson Delores Johansen said this move will   enable the Olympic Committee to save money. \"It only makes goos fiscal   sense to abandon the drug testing\", she stated, \"drug testing costs   thousands of dollars per athlete. We will now be able to make the Games   profitable without destroying the good names of the athletes.\"   Dr. Harvey Johnson, the US Olympic Committee\\'s chief of Medicine said   that this could be the best thing for the athletes. \"As long as they   are taking the drugs under a doctors supervision they will be fine\", he   stated. \"It\\'s only dangerous when they take the drugs off the street   and try to hide it from urinalysis that it becomes a problem. The   athletes will be much healthier if they don\\'t go downing all those   cover-ups agents. That\\'s where the real health threats lie\".   Dr. Johnson recommends anabolic steroids for weight-lifters, gymnasts,   short distance runners and anyone doing strength training. He also   recommended Human Growth Hormone to aid distance runners in their   recovery capacity and, in particular, help female runners build up   strength and endurance. He did advise against wanton use of   amphetamines as the could cause a hear attack. \"But they will make you   run a little faster so the choice is yours\", Dr. Johnson continued.   The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is opposed to the Olympic   Committee\\'s decision. \"We have spent years trying to prevent people   from taking drugs and enjoying themselves\", said WADA spokesperson   Francois Egalite. \"We can\\'t have athletes taking things like   androstenediol, androstenedione, bolasterone, boldenone, clenbuterol,   clostebol, danazol, dehydrochlormethyltestosterone,   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dihydrotestosterone, drostanolone,   fluoxymesterone, formebolone, gestrinone, mesterolone, metandienone,   metenolone, methandriol, methyltestosteroiie, mibolerone, nandrolone,   19-norandrostenediol, 19-norandrostenedione, norbolethone,   norethandrolone, oxandrolone, oxymesterone, oxymetholone, salbutamol,   stanozolol, testosterone and trenbolone! \" It just wouldn\\'t be right!

       " 'training-0508': {'body': \"   President Clinton said Friday he was ``disappointed'' by Panama's   refusal to accept Haitian refugees but that his administration is   searching for other temporary homes for the fleeing islanders.   Clinton seemed frustrated, but he refused to analyze Thursday's move by   Panama President Guillermo Endara to back out on a deal to accept   thousands of Haitian refugees, who were to be housed on former U.S.   military bases.   Panama's withdrawal from the plan leaves only three small Caribbean   islands -- Grenada, Antigua and Dominica -- as publicly ready to accept   fleeing Haitians.   The situation leaves U.S. ships with no place to take the more than   10,000 refugees who have been picked up at sea since Monday.   Coast Guard cutters and Navy warships are so overloaded with boat   people that, in some cases, they cannot pick up any more Haitians,   according to the U.S. Embassy in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.   The Pentagon said 1,859 more boat people were picked up Friday. But 407   asked to be sent home when told they could not seek U.S. asylum by   leaving Haiti.   ``My concern right now is to build a network of friends in the   hemisphere who agree that the Haitians are entitled to consideration   ... and who want to help us to do it,'' Clinton said at a news   conference before the opening of the annual economic summit here.   About the only sanctuary that Clinton seemed to rule out was the   Haitians' apparent favorite -- southern Florida, where the prospect of   additional Caribbean refugees is a volatile political issue.   Although Clinton refused to dissect the Panamanian action, White House   press secretary Dee Dee Myers said: ``They changed their minds.''   ``Obviously, the situation in Panama did not work out as we hoped,''   Myers said. ``We had an agreement with them.''   Clinton fought off several attempts by reporters to pin him down on how   likely he is to order U.S. military intervention to force out Haiti's   rulers, who took power in a coup three years ago, and restore elected   President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.   Clinton repeated that he would not rule out any options, including use   of military force. In the final answer of his 30-minute news   conference, he said: ``I think the conduct of the military leaders (in   Haiti) will have more than anything else to do with what options are   considered when. And their conduct has not been good.''   Earlier in the news conference, Clinton recalled that the generals   leading the coup government had promised to leave.   ``They continue to violate the international community's sense of   decency and to violate human rights, and they're in there illegally and   they ought to go,'' Clinton said.   Clinton has been under heavy pressure from the Congressional Black   Caucus to take stronger action against Haiti's rulers. Caucus Chairman   Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., charged Friday that the administration was   conducting a ``policy of anarchy'' with constant shifts that are   causing an ``erosion of American prestige abroad.''   Mfume said air strikes against military targets in Haiti should be   considered, but he was concerned that ``it not be handled as sloppily   as we have handled the refugee problem.''   Clinton did not talk about Haiti in the opening statement at his news   conference on the Naples waterfront, but questions about the troubled   nation dominated his meeting with reporters.   Clinton took pains to defend the recent switch in policy, which denies   the possibility of asylum in the United States to Haitians who flee   their island homeland in boats. While those refugees would be offered   safe havens in other Caribbean nations, they will eventually be   returned to Haiti, the White House has said.   ``There is no internationally recognized human right to go to a   particular place and to have a particular response,'' Clinton said.   Haitians can currently apply for U.S. asylum by going to a consular   center in Haiti, and Clinton said the United States has stepped up that   effort.   ``And we know that people are able to get to those processing   centers,'' he said.   But given the increase in violence in Haiti, Clinton said, ``There is a   limit to how much the United States or anybody else can do.''\",\n",

That was the second month in a row that the retail sales were flat,   reflecting the weak demand in the economy.   Year-on-year, retail sales in July were up by 3 percent.   In July, the increase of sales at stores of sporting goods, health and   personal care products, and clothes were offset by the decrease of   sales at gasoline stations and car dealerships.   Gasoline sales dropped a record 4.2 percent in July, after a 3. 6   percent fall as prices at the pump retreated after peaking in May.   Car sales fell 0.5 percent in July, after a 0.5 percent increase the   month before. Excluding automobile sales, retail sales rose 0.2 percent   in July, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in June.   Economists say that layoffs, eroding consumer confidence and stock   market volatility contributed to shoppers being more choosy.   Elsewhere in the report, sales for a category that includes sporting   goods, hobby shops and music stores rose 1.2 percent last month, after   a 0.7 percent increase. Sales at clothing stores rose 0.9 percent,   following a 0.5 percent decline.   At health and personal care stores, sales rose 1.7 percent, following a   0.4 percent increase.

       " 'training-2041': {'body': \"   Bosnian Serbs on Friday shrugged off high-level international talks on   ways to stop their attacks on Muslim civilians, menacing one tottering   Muslim enclave and tightening the noose around another.   Though the United Nations said Zepa was fairly quiet, Bosnian radio   reported new attacks on the U.N. ``safe area,'' and U.N. officials   agreed to beef up mediating efforts there between desperate government   army defenders and besieging Serbs. The Bosnian army has no hopes of   holding on to Zepa but refuses to abandon it unless Serbs agree to let   defending soldiers join a planned exodus of civilians.   The Serbs held all men of fighting age who didn't escape after taking   Srebrenica, another enclave, July 11, and refugees' accounts of Serb   atrocities from there include mass killings of Muslim men they took.   ``We think that anywhere from 5,000 and maybe as many as 10,000 of the   civilian population of Srebrenica has been murdered ... after the city   was surrendered,'' said Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey.   Talking to reporters in Athens, Greece, he claimed the Serbs killed   1,600 ``mostly boys and older men'' in one incident alone, in a soccer   stadium in Bratunac, near Srebrenica.   Though U.N. agencies have compiled hundreds of accounts of atrocities,   no independent substantiation has been possible.   Radio also reported shelling of Gorazde, another Muslim enclave further   south, which, though still relatively secure in government hands, is   facing the threat of mass hunger.   ``Regardless of any imminent military threat to Gorazde, it is being   slowly starved and strangled,'' said U.N. aid spokesman Ron Redmond, in   Geneva.   Redmond, with UNHCR, the main refugee agency, spoke of ``desperate''   food shortages among the enclave's 50,000-60,000 people, saying only   one convoy had reached them since May 20. Medical supplies were also   extremely scarce, he said.   With Gorazde the next possible Serb target of conquest, Western leaders   were meeting in London with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros   Boutros-Ghali to discuss ways of protecting it, the last secure Muslim   ``safe area'' in eastern Bosnia.   As the world focused on how to save Gorazde, shells slammed into   Sarajevo, wounding 10 people, four of them children. And   anti-government forces increased attacks on another ``safe area'' _   this one in western Bosnia.   Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, reported major advances in the Bihac   pocket by renegade Muslims supported by rebel Serbs, saying they had   taken 50 square kilometers (20 square miles) in the last three days.   Bosnian radio said shelling in the Bihac region killed four young boys   and wounded more than 30 other civilians. Other unconfirmed reports   said thousands of refugees were fleeing.   The anti-government alliance of rebel Serbs and Muslims in northwestern   Bosnia seemed set to exploit the attention being paid to Gorazde to   grab Bihac. Defeat of the government army's Bihac contingent would   allow rebel Serbs in Bosnia and neighboring Croatia to link up in a   region with important rail and road ties.   Redmond, the UNHCR spokesman, also painted a dismal aid picture for   Bihac.   ``Less than 11 percent of what is required for Bihac has been getting   through, and it's been like this since May of 1994, so it's already a   very desperate situation,'' he said.   The U.N. agreed to send a more senior official to Zepa to help the two   sides negotiate after local Bosnian army commanders had threatened to   kill Ukranian peacekeepers based there otherwise.   Even before the United Nations gave in, a deadline passed with none of   the Ukranians coming to harm, said Alexander Ivanko, a U.N. spokesman.   At the London meeting, the United States is proposing a large-scale air   assault if the Serbs attack the enclave of Gorazde. The talks are also   trying to find ways to open Sarajevo to aid shipments.   Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, in a telephone conversation late   Thursday with U.S. President Clinton, criticized ``the lack of U.S.   leadership'' in the war and appealed for ``firmer use of air strikes.''   On Friday, Bosnian radio reported him meeting with Turkish President   Suleyman Demirel in the central Bosnian town of Zenica.   Serbs attacked Zepa late Thursday after the Bosnian Serb commander,   Gen. Ratko Mladic, was rebuffed in a demand that authorities surrender   the entire mountainous enclave by 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) Thursday.   The local army refused because the Serbs planned to detain all men   between 18 and 55 and exchange them for Serb prisoners, said Maj.   Myriam Sochacki, a U.N. spokeswoman.   The United Nations sent in a small liaison team of low-ranking   officials Thursday to discuss safe passage for thousands of women,   children and elderly to central Bosnia, and the evacuation of about 35   wounded to Sarajevo.   Serbs drove 60 buses to the enclave to use in the evictions of the   Muslims. There had been an estimated 10,000 to 16,000 people in Zepa,   and Izetbegovic said 6,000 were ``in deadly danger.''   The United Nations earlier admitted it was powerless to guarantee safe   passage for women and children leaving Zepa, or to prevent mistreatment   of prisoners held by the Serbs. (pvs/sk/gj)\",\n",

That sum -- the maximum a US president may authorize under the Foreign   Assistance Act without congressional approval -- includes 12 million   dollars for air- and sea-lifts and three million dollars in equipment   announced by White House spokesman Michael McCurry earlier Thursday.   The Clinton administration is working out allocation of the remaining   35 million dollars in in-kind support with US allies in Europe,   according to the White House official, who asked that his name not be   used.   Washington will also consider sending another 10 million dollars in   intelligence equipment and close air support, and it may pay up to 35   million dollars in cash to support 2,000 Rapid Reaction Force troops,   he said.   \"Our main premise is that voluntary contributions should be the primary   means of financing the Rapid Reaction Force,\" set up by Britain and   France, with participation by the Netherlands and Denmark, the official   said.   The European allies have requested intelligence, navigation,   communications, and refuelling equipment as well as small arms and   night-vision goggles, he said. US contributions will comprise surplus   equipment not earmarked for a military unit, he added.   \"We have ready reserve force ships ready to go to England,\" the   official said. \"The Pentagon is proceeding with these kinds of   contributions.\"   One US ship, the Cape Race, has already set sail for Britain from   Norfolk, Virgina, and another, the Cape Diamond, will leave in July   from Jacksonville, Florida, he said.   Clinton has promised to do everything in his power to assure US   financial backing for the French- and British-led force, but the   Republican majority in Congress has opposed any US funding.   In Bonn, a German cabinet meeting decided Monday to provide up to 14   Tornado jet fighters -- to be based in northern Italy -- for the Rapid   Reaction Force as well as transport planes and medical units,   mobilising 1,500 men to underpin UN operations in Bosnia.

       " 'training-2044': {'body': \"   Here he is now, at age 42, weighing about 300 pounds, with less body   fat than a quart of skim milk, going through a routine at World Gym in   Venice, Calif., that makes you feel guilty for all the times in your   life you've taken the elevator instead of the stairs.   In the interim, Lou Ferrigno has competed for and won some of the most   prestigious titles in the cultish world of bodybuilding; endured and   then recovered from an abusive father who couldn't stand to see his   ``slow'' son succeed; starred for five seasons as TV's ``The Incredible   Hulk''; married and is helping to raise three children; appeared and   lectured all over the globe; worked as a personal trainer for   celebrities, including Mickey Rourke and Chuck Norris, and has written   an autobiography that is due out in two weeks.   Now he's back. Pumping iron. Working out. Competing. Going back to the   drawing board, with a single-minded focus as if all of the above never   happened.   Ferrigno has come out of bodybuilding ``retirement'' to train for and   compete in the inaugural Masters Olympia contest, which takes place   Sept. 9 in Atlanta.   ``My goal is to be in the best shape of my life,'' said the former Mr.   Olympia Wednesday after a workout at the Venice gym.   This is saying something. Since the days back in Brooklyn, when he   first picked up some of his father's barbells and muscle magazines that   were always strewn around the house, Lou Ferrigno has never exactly let   himself go.   He not only achieved personal satisfaction by transforming himself from   scrawny to brawny and earning worldwide fame in the process, he and   Arnold Schwarzenegger became perhaps the two most influential   ambassadors of the expand-and-contract set.   And although Schwarzenegger is surely the starrier name because of his   exploits on celluloid, Ferrigno is revered more by serious weight men.   ``He's a bodybuilder's bodybuilder,'' noted Don ``Ripper'' Ross, a   former Mr. America and professional wrestler who also works out at   World Gym. ``A lot of fans are excited about the Masters competition   because Lou will be in it, along with other heroes of the past.''   Ira Bankofsky is one of Ferrigno's closest and dearest friends. The two   began working out together 25 years ago at R&AMP;J Health Studio in   Brooklyn. He has been at Ferrigno's side for some of his greatest   triumphs, including his Mr. America title in 1973 and Mr. Universe wins   in '73 and '74.   After a long separation -- partly due to the disruptive ways of   Ferrigno's father Matt -- Bankofsky is back, working daily with   Ferrigno in preparation for the Masters event.   Said Ferrigno: ``He's the only one who can push my buttons.''   ``I guarantee you that he will be by far the most popular person on   that stage,'' Bankofsky said.   It wasn't always so.   Ferrigno grew up with a severe hearing deficiency as well as a speech   impediment. Aside from the cruel taunts he had to endure from   outsiders, his father would compound the problem inside their own   abode.   Whatever Lou did wasn't good enough. Whatever he tried to do was   stupid. Whatever he wanted to do was a foolish dream.   ``He was very abusive, both physically and mentally,'' Ferrigno said.   ``I carried his anger and pain around all my life. I was resentful. He   always told me I wouldn't amount to anything.''   Even in Ferrigno's finest moments, his father wouldn't relent.   Bankofsky helped train Ferrigno prior to the making of the bodybuilding   classic, ``Pumping Iron.''   ``As soon as he found out about the movie,'' Bankofsky said of   Ferrigno's father, ``he said, `Don't talk to Ira anymore. I'm gonna   train you.'''   The film depicted Ferrigno and his father as a team. True, but it was a   team with no camaraderie, no positive energy, no chemistry, no love. It   was a team that disintegrated soon after it was assembled.   ``When I won, he would come around,'' Ferrigno said. ``When I was down,   he didn't give a (expletive).''   Ferrigno said he hasn't spoken to his father -- or to his brother and   sister -- in six years.   It took many more years of therapy for Ferrigno to understand his   torment and to let the pain go. With the help of his wife of 15 years,   Carla, his kids, his friends and his following, Ferrigno now is in his   most positive mental state in years.   Each day for the past 12 months, he has been following a rigorous   program that involves a two-hour workout with weights in the morning at   World Gym, then an hour of posing at his home in Santa Monica, followed   by a cardiovascular workout in the evening.   To attain such attributes as 23-inch arms and a 60-inch chest, he has   given up alcohol and sugar and no morsel of food gets past his gums   without great scrutiny. He is making sacrifices now as he made when he   first discovered his love for lifting weights and building muscles.   ``People over 40 are more interested in staying healthy than young   people,'' he said. ``It would be such a wonderful feeling to say that   age 42 I am the best bodybuilder in the world. I think it would give   people the hope that they could do the same thing.''   There is an expression: ``No pain, no gain.'' Lou Ferrigno would   probably be the first to tell you how true it is.

       " 'training-2046': {'body': '   The United States threatened Thursday to veto a renewal of the UN force in   Bosnia unless the Security Council meets its demand to exempt peacekeepers   from the new International Criminal Court.   \"A veto is definitely an option if the issue is not resolved,\" the US   ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte, told reporters as he   emerged from two hours of consultations behind closed doors.   The mandate of the UN police-training mission in Bosnia (UNMIBH)   expires at midnight Sunday (0400 GMT Monday), the precise moment the   ICC comes into being, and Negroponte said the United States wanted the   question settled by then.   \"Unlike last week, we are not prepared to consider just another   technical rollover, to extend the Bosnia mandate without any kind of   resolution of this question,\" he said.   Unable to reach a compromise, the 15-member council decided Friday to   extend UNMIBH for nine days instead of the usual six months so as to   buy itself time for reflection.   Unlike the 19,000-strong NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia (SFOR),   the United Nations force of 1,536 police officers, three military and   1,747 civilian staff cannot continue to exist without a Security   Council mandate.   Negroponte on Thursday proposed an amendment to UNMIBH\\'s mandate to   give all current and former members of the mission \"immunity from   arrest, detention and prosecution\" by the ICC. The text was distributed   to reporters.   Western European diplomats said the wording was unacceptable because it   undermined the court\\'s statute and its aims.   France\\'s ambassador to the United Nations, Jean-David Levitte,   suggested alternative wording which would have the effect of deferring   action by the ICC against the Bosnia mission for a year.   Council consultations were scheduled to resume on Friday morning.   A diplomat from a non-aligned country council member said the United   States had no hope of mustering the nine votes necessary to adopt a   resolution.   \"The US is isolated on this, and they know they are isolated,\" he said,   adding that calls for immunity \"will not fly\" with other council   members.   All 15 European Union countries and 54 other states have ratified the   statute under which the court, to be set up in The Hague, will try   cases of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.   The administration of President George W. Bush is openly hostile to the   ICC, and on May 6 it withdrew the United States signature from the   ICC\\'s founding statute.   Supporters of the court, including UN Secretary General Kofi Annan,   have noted that the statute includes safeguards against frivolous or   politically-motivated prosecutions.   One such safeguard, Article 16, says: \"No investigation or prosecution   may be commenced or proceeded with under this statute for a period of   12 months after the Security Council ... has requested the Court to   that effect.\"   Levitte\\'s proposal, also distributed to reporters, was to automatically   invoke Article 16 for UNMIBH.   Human Rights Watch accused the United States on Thursday of holding   UNMIBH hostage.   \"When you think what the people of Bosnia have endured over the past   decade, it is shameful to see US government policy shrink to this,\"   Richard Dicker, a lawyer with the New York-based human rights body,   told a news conference here.   Dicker called on all states that have ratified or signed the statute to   \"make clear that this shall not pass, that the Security Council cannot   be instigated at the behest of any one government to amend a   multilateral treaty.\"   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said \"the   United States believes very seriously in the mission, but also believes   very seriously we can\\'t allow that mission to be compromised by the   International Criminal Court.\"   Boucher indicated that the final decision would be taken at a higher   level than UN ambassadors.   Secretary of State Colin Powell \"has been in conversations with a   number of foreign ministers on this issue,\" he said.',\n",

The brother of Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of the Irish   Republican Army\\'s political wing, Sinn Fein, was in the aisles of Gorey   parish church along with convicted IRA terrorist Raymond McCartney, to   hear priest Father Walter Forde say that O\\'Brien had been \"hijacked by   the Godfathers of the IRA\".   Outside the church, two IRA members who had escaped from prison in   England, Nessan Quinlivan and Pierce McCauley, were watched by scores   of policemen who have staked out the 4,000-strong village over the past   three days.   There was none of the display of arms during the ceremony that has   characterised funerals of other IRA members who have died in \"active   service\" and been buried with \"military honours\" from the armed   paramilitary fighters.   O\\'Brien\\'s family condemned the bombing, which injured nine other   innocent victims, as well as the Sinn Fein movement.   Armed police stopped and controlled any vehicle trying to enter the   village, where the church has been under guard since Monday to ensure   that no IRA graffiti or insignia would be posted ahead of the ceremony.   The vast majority of mourners gathered under the spring sun wore white   ribbons on their lapels, that the priest had supplied as symbols of   peace to demonstrate their horror and rejection of IRA violence.   Father Forde commiserated with the bomber\\'s family, who must \"try to   make sense of how a young man, barely out of his teens, was drawn into   the sordid and terrible world of terrorism\".   He added that the entire community must try to understand how 0\\'Brien\\'s   \"misguided idealism was hijacked, reshaped and distorted by the   godfathers of the IRA\".

       " 'training-2289': {'body': \"   The San Diego Chargers discount predictions of a Super Bowl blowout.   They expect that San Francisco will be able to stay close.   The Chargers are saying they plan to win. Oddsmakers, on the other   hand, say the 49ers will fleece, flatten, trounce, trample, thrash,   bash, blitz, berate, deflate, confuse, abuse and defuse the Chargers.   San Francisco is favored by 19 points -- the largest point spread in   Super Bowl history. That means a final score of 26-7. Or 39-20. Or   50-31.   The Chargers may be the only people in America who think they can win.   ``According to the national news, we're not supposed to be here,'' San   Diego linebacker Junior Seau said.   ``All it does is show you're not respected, and you're not to the level   where you should be respected yet. To get that, you have to do   something rare. That's to win the Super Bowl.''   It should be noted that the previous largest Super Bowl point spread   was 18 points, and in that game, the underdogs won. Quarterback Joe   Namath and the New York Jets pulled off an upset he guaranteed, beating   Baltimore 16-7 in 1969 at Miami.   With the lack of news, media questions keep coming back to one subject   -- the unprecedented point spread.   ``I don't like it,'' 49ers coach George Seifert said. ``It demonstrates   disrespect for San Diego. There must be something special about them,   or they wouldn't be here.''   ``To me, it wouldn't be an upset if we come out and win the game,''   Chargers running back Natrone Means said. ``We're capable of winning.''   But don't bet on it. All signs point in favor of the 49ers.   They led the National Football League in scoring and eliminated   two-time defending league champion Dallas to reach the Super Bowl for   the fifth time since 1982. The Chargers, picked by some to finish last   in the AFC West, struggled after a 6-0 start and needed desperate   rallies in both playoff games to earn their first Super Bowl berth.   ``The 49ers have had a lot more success than we've had in the past,''   San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries said. ``But we're both here now,   and it all comes down to Sunday.''   The Chargers are bucking not only 49ers tradition, but National   Football Conference tradition as well. The conference has won 10   consecutive Super Bowls.   At this point, it's fair to wonder whether an AFC team could beat Tampa   Bay in the Super Bowl. Recent NFC victories have been by such margins   as 45, 36, 35, 32 and 22 points.   And none of those teams was favored by 19.   ``It's not really a slam on the talent we have,'' San Diego linebacker   David Griggs said with a shrug. ``It's an indication of what the AFC   has done the last 10 years. I think the media is looking at the AFC as   a 19-point underdog, and not looking at the Chargers as 19-point   underdogs.   ``We're not saying it should be even up. We're underdogs. But they   can't take the 19-point spread, take the trophy and go home. They've   got to beat us.''\",\n",

Mike Joyce, drummer with the now-defunct group, famous for its   doom-laden lyrics, won his claim that he was entitled to 25 percent of   the four-man band\\'s profits from record royalties and performances.   Morrissey and lead guitarist Johnny Marr, who wrote the words and songs   for the group\\'s hit records, including \"Heaven Knows I\\'m Miserable   Now\", had paid only 10 percent each of the band\\'s earnings to Joyce and   bass guitarist Andy Rourke.

       " 'training-1582': {'body': \"   Combat spread to northern Bosnia on Friday in the absence of any   momentum toward restarting peace talks.   Despite visits by European diplomats and the top U.N. official for   former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, officials in the Serbian capital   Belgrade made clear they would not go for a new international   initiative.   Mediators were trying to get Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, to   recognize four former Yugoslav republics, including Croatia and Bosnia,   in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions.   Such a move would end the dream of uniting Serbs in Serbia, Bosnia and   Croatia in one state. It would isolate Serb rebels in Croatia and   Bosnia, and mediators hoped it could forestall new fighting in spring   and summer.   Most of Bosnia has been quiet since the beginning of the year under a   cease-fire agreement that lasts until May 1. Only in the far northwest   corner, around the government-held town of Bihac, has there been   consistent fighting.   Bosnian radio claimed fighting there intensified late Thursday and   early Friday. But the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees   in Zagreb, Croatia, said the third convoy in three days, with 116 tons   of food, reached hungry civilians in government-controlled territory.   Civilians there are malnourished, and UNHCR officials have warned they   could start starving soon without regular food shipments.   Fighting also was spreading slowly to other parts of Bosnia.   Foremost among them was northern Bosnia. U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Gary   Coward said in Sarajevo that there had been an increase in shelling and   gunfire all along the front lines between Bosnian Serbs and the   Muslim-led government in the vicinity of Maglaj, which protrudes into   Serb-held land.   Another U.N. spokesman, Maj. Herve Gourmelon, reported an increase in   shelling on two other points -- Serb-held Doboj and the Serbs' vital   Posavina corridor. Doboj, north of Maglaj, controls access to a bulge   of Serb-held land that is nearly surrounded by the government.   The corridor, only a few kilometers (miles) across at its narrowest, is   all that connects Serb-held western Bosnia and Serb-held parts of   Croatia with Serbia proper. Many analysts consider it the key to the   conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia.   Some shelling also was reported around government-held Zenica and   Travnik in central Bosnia, and Tuzla to the north. Bosnian army sources   said they had attacked Bosnian Serbs north of Travnik, and that   shelling of the town and Zenica could be the Serb response.   In Belgrade, Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic of Serb-led   Yugoslavia said his country had no intention of recognizing Croatia. It   has widely been assumed that Milosevic would evenutally agree to   recognize that rival state in order to get sanctions lifted.   But Jovanovic said that recognizing Croatia was not on the government's   agenda.   He said sanctions must be lifted first. ``The lifting of sanctions is   the most acute and ripe issue, upon which the speed of solving other   issues depends,'' he said.   That was a blunt reiteration of Yugoslavia's message over the weekend   after talks between Milosevic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei   Kozyrev.   Milosevic, whose nationalist rhetoric is regarded as one of the main   causes of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, was meeting with Akashi on   Friday.   Tough economic sanctions were slapped on Serb-led Yugoslavia in 1992 to   punish it for helping the rebel Serbs in those former Yugoslav   republics.   In addition to the war in Bosnia, which broke out in April 1992,   officials are concerned that the 1991 Serb-Croat war in Croatia will   reignite. Croatia, frustrated that the United Nations had not been able   to force a reintegration of the third of the republic under Serb   control, has ordered 12,000 peacekeepers to begin leaving March 31.   U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko in Sarajevo said Akashi was talking to   Milosevic about the end of the U.N. mandate in Croatia.\",\n",

About 95 percent of the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolia Prairie have now   abandoned the traditional Mongolian yurt homes for their own wood and   brick houses. And about 80 percent of Mongolian herdsmen are working as   farmers, businessmen and industrial workers nowadays.   While Inner Mongolia was incapable of producing even matches and nails   50 years ago, it has developed its own metallurgy, machinery,petroleum,   electronics, textile, sugar, food and garment industries during the   past 50 years.   Some Mongolians have also become shrewd business people who are engaged   in cross-border trade or have started their own businesses.

       " 'training-1587': {'body': '   Russian and Chechen negotiators resumed peace talks Saturday with both   sides saying a military accord aimed at ending the conflict in Chechnya   would be signed later in the day.   An exchange of prisoners also looked nearer, but the key issue of   Chechnya\\'s political future as an independent republic or a part of the   Russian Federation appeared as far away as ever with no sign of an   imminent settlement.   Chechen chief negotiator Usman Imayev said a military accord would be   \"signed later today\" as he arrived at the offices in Grozny of the   Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is   chairing the talks.   Russian negotiators also said they expected an agreement to be signed   during the day.   Negotiations had been adjourned for three days because of continued   disputes over sovereignty, but both sides appeared to have put that to   one side for the moment.   Arkady Volsky, one of the chief Russian negotiators, said earlier that   the military issues would be at the centre of Saturday\\'s meeting.   The talks started more than an hour late after the Chechen delegation   said they were held up at a Russian army checkpoint, Imayev explained.   \"We were held at a Russian post as we returned from the mountains where   we talked with (separatist leader Dzhokhar) Dudayev and Chechen   commanders on the ground,\" he added.   Both sides signed a military protocol on June 22 agreeing a separation   of forces, a gradual retreat of Russian troops, an exchange of   prisoners and an indefinite ceasefire, but the agreement has yet to be   finalised in a formal accord.   Vladimir Ivanov, Russian delegate with responsibility for prisoners,   said on arrival he had lists of Chechens held in Russian camps in the   Caucasus towns of Pyatigorsk, Stavropol and Krasnodar and would hand   them to the Chechens.   Chechen negotiators had earlier refused to hand over full lists of   Russians held by their fighters, complaining the Russians were merely   proposing to give them incomplete lists of civilians held in Grozny and   Mozdok, their rear base, in exchange.   \"The exchange of prisoners should now take place very quickly,\" Ivanov   said.   Russian troops stormed into Chechnya on December 11 to quell a   three-year secessionist movement. Since then between 15,000 and 30,000   people have died, according to various government and private   estimates.   Meanwhile Chechen separatist fighters in the mountain base of   Roshny-Shu claimed that Dudayev\\'s representative in Moscow, Khama   Kurbanov, had been arrested inside Chechnya.   They said his driver told them his car was stopped at a Russian   checkpoint where Kurbanov was ordered out and taken away by helicopter.   Kurbanov had previously been arrested when a Chechen commando unit   seized 1,500 hostages in the southern Russian town of Budennovsk in   mid-June, but he was released on Monday without being charged.   In Moscow the Russian Constitutional Court said it would issue its   ruling Monday on the legality of two decrees by Russian President Boris   Yeltsin and a government resolution which led to the intervention in   Chechnya.   It was asked for a ruling by both chambers of parliament which said a   proposal to intervene militarily in the republic should have been   decided by the legislature.   The head of Chechnya\\'s Moscow-installed government called for Russian   troops to be withdrawn from Grozny because of repeated incidents of   rape and looting, Interfax news agency reported.   Salambek Khadzhyev said 2,000 of the 40,000 soldiers in the republic   were \"criminals or people who aren\\'t psychologically normal\" who did   nothing but \"steal, loot, kidnap people and rape women.\"   The Russian army said two soldiers were killed and 12 injured in 12   separate attacks by Chechen fighters overnight to Saturday, Interfax   reported.',\n",

The closest airport that could be used for an evacuation is   about a one to two hour helicopter ride away in Sierra Leone, he said.   The 10-member US Army team was attached to the US European Command in   Heidelberg, Germany, he said.

The Sankei Shimbun, quoting Japanese government sources, said the   Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) was finalising   the plan in an effort to conclude the seven-year project by 2003 as   scheduled.   KEDO was established in 1995 under a US-North Korea nuclear deal to   provide Pyongyang with less-controversial light-water reactors to   replace North Korea's graphite-moderated reactors, which produce   weapons-grade plutonium.   The planned light-water reactor will be located in the costal town of   Sinpo some 270 kilometers (165 miles) northeast of Pyongyang, the   newspaper said.   But budget problems have remained unsolved as the project's estimated   cost has swollen from 4.5 billion dollars to five billion dollars, the   newspaper and government officials said.   Some South Korean officials have forecast the final price tag would   even go as high as six billion dollars to meet North Korea's request   for the construction of roads and other auxiliary facilities.   Japan has been expected to offer some 100 billion yen (926 million   dollars), but government sources recently said Tokyo would likely   shoulder more than 20 percent of the cost. South Korea is expected to   take on more than half of the cost.   In New York, North Korea and KEDO resumed negotiations on Thursday over   the issue, focusing on the project site, and the provision of North   Korean labour, goods, facilities and services linked to the project.   During the talks, the two sides have reportedly agreed in principle on   the issues of labour and goods needed for the construction. Pyongyang   and KEDO have also agreed to guarantee the status of engineers and   workers during the work, the Sankei said.   The talks in New York are the continuation of an earlier round in North   Korea at the end of July, during which the North Korean side reportedly   argued that its workers on the project should be paid special wages.\",\n",

Major, who is under increasing pressure from farmers and members of his   Conservative Party to scrap the slaughter plan, told reporters earlier   today that a cabinet meeting on Thursday would discuss new scientific   evidence.   Last month, some Oxford scientists, writing in the scientific journal   Nature, said that the mad cow disease would decline naturally and would   be over by 2001 without the planned slaughter of 147,000 cattle.   \"Nobody should expect snap decisions but it is right to examine and   make sure the policy is correct in the light of new information we now   have. There is no pre-ordained outcome,\" Major said.   The government ministers are poised to shelve the number of cattle to   be slaughtered and likely to abandon the selective cull plan   altogether, according to local press reports.   Sir David Naish, President of the National Farmers Union, said in a BBC   Radio interview today that \"First of all explore with Europe all the   opportunities and then make a decision.

Amid an intensifying crackdown on the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, which is   under a growing cloud of suspicion in the Tokyo subway nerve gas   attack, authorities also launched a second round of searches at cult   facilities.   The Japanese military dispatched 14 dangerous-chemicals specialists to   the scene of the arrest, near Hikone in western Japan. The military   squad was treating the automobile with chemicals so it could be safely   examined, officials said.   After being stopped, the driver tried to evade police, running red   lights and crashing into a truck, police said. Japanese TV showed   footage of police and military blocking off the area, and residents   could be seen looking on anxiously.   Meanwhile, more than 500 police wearing protective gear and carrying   caged canaries as gas detectors carried out new searches and took soil   samples Thursday at a rural sect commune near Mount Fuji where they   found nerve-gas solvent the previous day.   Media reports said more unspecified chemicals were found at the site.   Raids Wednesday on 25 of the group's properties across Japan also   turned up nerve-gas solvent, 22 pounds of gold and dlrs 7.9 million in   cash.   Several members of the Aum Shinri Kyo group, whose name means Sublime   Truth, were arrested Wednesday in a kidnapping case unrelated to the   Tokyo subway attack. Police would not say whether they were also being   questioned in the subway case, in which nerve gas killed 10 and   sickened nearly 5,000.   The group has strenuously denied any role in the attack. There is no   known motive and no claim of responsibility.   News reports Thursday said those arrested during raids on Wednesday   were doctors. They have not been publicly linked them to the subway   attack.   On the Tokyo subways on Thursday, investigators sought help directly   from commuters who were the victims of Monday's attack. Police were   handing out 50,000 leaflets asking passengers to report anything   suspicious they had seen around the time of the attack.   Police were trying to confirm sketchy reports that a   ``suspicious-looking man'' in his mid-40s entered the central Hibiya   Line at its starting poin with the chemicals in a paper bag, which he   set down before leaving the train at Ebisu station.   Another man is thought to have left a small package wrapped in   newspaper on the Hibiya line before running out of the train at   Kodenma-cho station.   Investigators have been examining evidence gathered in the subways for   several days now, and media reports say police are starting to piece   together a better picture of how the attack was carried out.   Police have found several fragments of broken glass inside boxlike   packages on affected trains, the daily Mainichi paper reported. Citing   sources, it said investigators theorized that attackers dropped or   kicked the packages to break the glass and fled while the fumes began   seeping out.   There was no word on the fate of a suspect police were reported to have   under guard in a hospital. Witnesses said he planted one of the deadly   parcels before being overcome by its fumes.   Japanese media said investigators were waiting until he recovered   sufficiently to be questioned.   The nerve gas used in Monday's attack, developed by Nazi scientists,   caused passengers to retch, faint and have convulsions. Several hundred   people remained hospitalized in the wake of the attack, 52 of them in   serious or critical condition.   The nerve gas attack has left Japanese shocked by the assault on their   safe, efficient train system and their orderly way of life.   ``While it is hard to build a safe society, it is very easy to destroy   it,'' commented the national newspaper Asahi.   Despite the resolve the raids showed, authorities were clearly treating   the sect with kid gloves. During Wednesday's raids, police employed   notable restraint, using no weapons to subdue sect followers who   resisted being led away.   Officials are also being careful to avoid acknowledging that the   investigation of the cult is directly linked to the subway attacks,   although that is widely believed to be the case.   The raids on cult buildings and compounds, meanwhile, are yielding   frightening evidence of the sect's hold over its followers.   At the rural compound near Mount Fuji, police on Wednesday found 50   people who were weak and ill. Six were hospitalized, and press reports   Thursday said they had been drugged.   Police said a 23-year-old female sect member told them she had been   drugged and confined in a container at the compound.   In a chilling development, the sect's leader, Shoko Asahara, was   reported to have delivered an apocalyptic-sounding message to followers   in the Russian Far East.   ``The time has come at last for you to awake and help me,'' Asahara   said in the message, broadcast Wednesday night by Japan's NHK   television. ``You must act to ensure you do not have any regrets about   death.''\",\n",

LeBaron spoke at the end of a four-day meeting of delegates from 42   countries to discuss water shortages in the the arid region and   environmental protection.

LeBaron, whose country chairs the water working group, said Germany was   working closely with Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians on studies to   assess water availability.   Luxembourg, Sweden and the Netherlands have projects to help regional   countries _ primarily the Palestinians _ better manage their water   resources, he told a news conference.

Protesters who lined the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route and turned   their backs on the president\\'s motorcade had the stated goal of   \"forcing President Bush to respond to widespread criticism of his   administration.\" To the disappointment of Heiko and his fellow   protesters, Bush was able to continue to ignore widespread criticism,   because of the one person who didn\\'t show up.   \"If 25,000 protesters had turned their backs on Bush, he would have   publicly acknowledged that a huge portion of America disapproves of his   policies,\" Heiko said. \"As it is, 24,999 of us wasted our Wednesday on   a little monkey charade.\"   Polls confirmed that, due to underattendance, the protest also failed   to reach its second goal: altering public opinion of Bush.   Casey Baldwin of Lake Charles, LA saw a photograph of the protests on   page A32 of the Natchitoches Times.   \"There were 24,999 of them standing out there, facing the wrong way,\"   Baldwin said. \"It looked pretty silly, to tell the truth.\"   Heiko said he was reluctant to censure the person responsible for   turning what would have been a successful protest into an irrelevant   social hour.   \"Maybe the one person who allowed Bush to ignore the opinions of 45   percent of America has a busy schedule,\" Heiko said. \"I sure hope he   had a good reason for making all 24,999 of us stand out in the cold   looking foolish for three hours.\"   In Quantum Power To The People, Alan Jeffords explains that protests   must attain a \"magical number\" in order to be effective.   \"Often, an individual believes that his participation in a protest   isn\\'t important,\" Jeffords said. \"This couldn\\'t be further from the   truth. In every protest that has ever failed in the entire history of   the world, the failure has been scientifically traced back to a single   individual who didn\\'t bother to show up.\"   For both progressive and conservative protesters, this participation   tipping point often proves maddeningly elusive.   In 1998, the Sierra Club\\'s rally to protect an old-growth forest in   northeastern Washington failed because Seattle environmentalist Eddie   Burgess decided to forgo the protest and \"jam with his buddies.\"   In 1999, the effort to withdraw city funding from the Brooklyn Art   Museum for the Sensation exhibition would have been successful, had Jed   Maheu shown up on the exhibit\\'s opening day. Instead, Maheu spent the   day with his daughter, and taxpayer dollars funded the showing of a   Chris Ofili painting that used elephant dung and pornographic photos to   depict the Virgin Mary.   In April 2003, the massive Not In Our Name protests were one person   short of stopping the invasion of Iraq.

       " 'training-0763': {'body': \"   Militant Muslims vowed Monday to fight Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's   plans to curb their influence and take away their weapons.   Ms. Bhutto met with provincial leaders and government ministers Sunday   to map out a strategy to try to end the sectarian violence that has   killed or wounded hundreds of people in recent years.   Much of Ms. Bhutto's strategy appeared to be directed at controlling   thousands of religious schools, often considered the centers of   military training and fundamentalists teachings.   Many of these schools, known as madrases, are believed to be funded by   fundamentalists in the Middle East, particularly from Iran and Saudi   Arabia.   Ms. Bhutto promised to check the funding of the schools, outlaw   military training camps run by religious groups and weed out foreign   students who the government believes are troublemakers, a government   release said.   ``The government is dreaming if it thinks it will be able to control   the workings of the madrases,'' said Zia-ur-Rehman Farooqui, an   official of the militant Sunni group called the Soldiers of the Friends   of the Prophet.   ``We will not comply if the government tries to take away our weapons,   It would be suicide,'' he said.   Farooqui's group regularly clashes with militant Shiites, most of whom   belong to the Organization for the Implementation of Shiite laws.   Farooqui said Iran was the big backer of Pakistan's militant Shiites, a   charge they deny. Most Iranians are Shiites.   ``We have not taken even a dagger from the Iranian government,'' said   Allama Sajid Naqvi, chief of the Shiite group.   Most of Pakistan's 120 million people are Sunni Muslims and they   generally get along with their Shiite brethren.   But, in recent years militant groups have sprung up and they routinely   clash.   Last year, rival Islamists began attacking each other's mosques,   gunning down worshippers as they knelt in prayer, planting bombs in   prayer halls, killing and maiming hundreds of people.   A busload of Shiite Muslims were sprayed with bullets in the southern   city of Karachi killing eight people and wounding several others.   There were dozens of reports of mosques attacked by masked gunmen. Hit   squads began to appear, particularly in the southern port city of   Karachi, where much of the violence has been centered.   Gunmen stalked and killed several Shiite and Sunni activists.   While much of the violence has occurred in Karachi, several other   cities in Pakistan have been effected. Bombs have gone off in mosques   in the eastern city of Lahore and in central Punjab province, where 60   percent of Pakistanis live.   Earlier Ms. Bhutto warned that sectarian violence threatened Pakistan's   existence.   Iqbal Ahmed, a political analyst and university professor, said   graduates of religious schools are imbued with Islamic fervor and   little else.   They don't have the skills to get a decent job yet they believe they   are destined to run the country, he said.   ``These schools are turning out graduates who have no practical skills.   They have spent 15 years studying the Koran. When they graduate they   can't get a job, they get frustrated and join these radical groups,''   Ahmed said.\",\n",

Murdoch had planned to launch a Superleague, cutting the national   Australian competition from 20 teams to 12 with games broadcast around   the world through his world-wide television interests.   But his proposal was thwarted on Feburary 6 when billionaire Australian   magazine and television owner Kerry Packer persuaded Australian Rugby   League (ARL) clubs to reject his plan.   Packer reminded a meeting of all 20 club chief executives that his Nine   Network held the free-to-air television and cable television rights to   the game until 2000.   The 20 clubs unanimously rejected Murdoch\\'s plan and agreed to sign   loyalty agreements pledging support to the ARL-controlled competitions   for the next five years.   Ken Cowley, chief executive of Murdoch\\'s News Ltd., said in a statement   that it had taken action in the Federal Court against the ARL, the New   South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) Ltd. and six clubs playing in the   Winfield Cup contest.   He said the court would be asked to determine that agreements between   the ARL, the NSWRL and the clubs were in breach of the regulatory Trade   Practices Act.   Success in the action would allow News Ltd. to continue with its plans   to involve existing clubs in its plans for a Superleague competition,   Cowley said.   The chief of News Ltd., the Australasian arm of News Corp., said he   hoped to deal openly and directly with the administrators of the game,   as he always had done previously.   \"But you cannot go through the front door of the Australian Rugby   League if that door is locked by illegal barriers,\" he added.   \"The action begun today by News Ltd. is the key to allowing clubs to   consider the merits of our plans for a Superleague.\"   Cowley said the ARL was seeking to ban clubs from even talking with   News Ltd. and that \"what is best for the game as a whole and the   Winfield Cup clubs has been forgotten.\"   He said he was confident the court would find the ARL and the NSWRL had   breached trade practices legislation.   \"When that happens we will be talking with the clubs about making the   game of rugby league the best of the best,\" Cowley added.

Opposition legislator Lee Chul accused Washington of pressing Seoul to   shoulder the cost of replacing Pyongyang\\'s graphite-moderated reactors   with light-water systems, which produce less plutonium.   The US government wants Seoul to put up two billion dollars while using   Russian technology instead of South Korean models, Lee told parliament,   quoting documents allegedly obtained from US sources.   Lee said Washington was refusing to let South Korea provide its own   technology, which has been gathered in decades of tie-ups with the US,   Canada and France.   In recent talks in New York, Washington suggested Russia\\'s light-water   reactors be provided to Pyongyang, reportedly arguing that the cost   could be counted as partial repayment of South Korean loans to Moscow.   But Seoul opposed the US proposal, citing potential problems concerning   \"safety, technology and sovereignty,\" Science and Technology Miniser   Kim Si-Joong told parliament.   Kim said US, Japanese and South Korean officials discussed the question   of funding and replacing North Korea\\'s controversial reactors, but no   agreement has been reached.   He confirmed South Korea was ready to provide its nuclear technology to   North Korea, which has agreed to hold the first-ever inter-Korean   summit July 25-27 in Pyongyang.   South Korea has offered North Korea substantial economic benefits in   return for giving up its nuclear weapons program, including a program   to finance the transformation of its nuclear reactors.   Government officials told newspapers here Wednesday Seoul hoped to   supply technology to Pyongyang, but Washington was reluctant because   the South Korean model is based on US technology.   Japan also reportedly reacted unfavorably to the use of South Korean   technology and argued for an international consortium.   Washington recommended the Russian reactor because it is cheaper and   North Korea is more accustomed to Russian technology, guaranteeing   better safety management, the reports said.   But Kim said his government prefers the Korean-style reactors for North   Korea.   \"Our government is all prepared over this issue from the approach of   furnishing power to North Korea in economic cooperation,\" he added,   raising speculation here that the offer was to be included in a package   deal President Kim Young-Sam will take to the summit.   The question of changing North Korean reactors will be high on the   agenda on Friday, when Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of   state, sits down for talks with North Korean officials in Genvea.   North Korea conveyed its offer to freeze its controversial nuclear   program through former US president Jimmy Carter in Pyongyang in   mid-June.   Carter said on his return from Pyongyang that the North was interested   in replacing the graphite system with light-water reactors.   The flap over reactor changes comes as South Korea\\'s nuclear industry   is coming of age to seek out overseas markets for its technological   exports.   If North Korea accepts the South Korean offer, it would be South   Korea\\'s first export of nuclear technology, though interest is high in   China.',\n",

But there was no indication of an early release. The legal procedures   for that could take up to three months, Iraqi law experts and officials   close to the case said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.   The United States has appealed for the release of David Daliberti, 41,   of Jacksonville, Florida, and William Barloon, 39, of New Hampton,   Iowa, since their arrest March 13.   The men were convicted by a Baghdad court on March 25.   U.S. officials say the pair crossed the southern border with Kuwait by   accident on their way to visit friends at a U.N. border post.   A senior Iraqi official, Hassab al-Oubaidi of the foreign relations   department of the Baghdad parliament, suggested Saturday that the issue   of the Americans could be settled ``in the coming few days.'' But he   did not elaborate.   The legal experts said Daliberti and Barloon must present all relevant   papers and documents to the Appeals Court when they ask for a review of   their sentences.   U.S. officials have been working to secure the men's release through   the Polish Embassy, which handles American interests in Baghdad in the   absence of direct U.S.-Iraqi diplomatic relations.   Iraqi officials, like al-Oubaidi, have made vaguely hopeful remarks,   while others and government-run newspapers have taken tougher lines   that have made it difficult to discern what the official line is on the   jailed Americans.   For instance, al-Qadissiyah, the Defense Ministry's daily, said Sunday   that they are no different from Mexicans trying to immigrate illegally   to the United States.   It criticized what it called ``the spasms of American officials toward   Iraq's legal stance in punishing the Americans who sneaked into its   national territory.   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, noted Thursday that   he did not believe that two Americans entered Iraq accidentally, but   must have had a darker motive.   He and other senior officials have repeatedly said they suspect the   Americans' entry into Iraq was linked to U.S. efforts to blunt   Baghdad's drive to have U.N. trade sanctions lifted.   The embargo, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, has   devastated Iraq's economy and caused worsening hardship for most of the   country's 18 million people.   The chief of the U.N. Special Commission charged with dismantling   Iraq's weapons programs, Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus, is scheduled to   report to the Security Council this month on his mission and the   effectiveness of the elaborate surveillance system his inspectors have   installed across Iraq.   That report, if favorable to Baghdad, could intensify pressure by some   Security Council members, led by Russia, France and China, to ease the   sanctions.   The United States and Britain have blocked all efforts to soften or   lift the embargo, claiming Iraq is hiding biological weapons.

       " 'training-1365': {'body': '   Aum Supreme Truth\\'s frontman, Yoshinobu Aoyama, confessed to an array   of charges Wednesday on the opening day of a trial that saw prosecutors   portray his faith as a doomsday cult bent on unleashing a stockpile of   deadly nerve gas.   In the biggest trial so far of leaders of the outlawed sect, Aoyama, a   35-year-old disbarred lawyer, told a packed courtroom that he had   joined Aum in 1988 in a bid to gain \"salvation\" through its   proto-Buddhist, yogic teachings.   But now, he said, he could only feel contrition for the sect\\'s deeds.   \"I deeply regret what has happened and I\\'m ashamed of my folly. I   should not have done what I did,\" Aoyama said. \"I accept responsibility   for it.\"   Prosecutors launched their attack with a chilling description of how   Aum stealthily built up an arsenal of deadly nerve-gas and then   released it at night in a village in the foothills of the Japanese   alps, killing seven inhabitants.   Aum\\'s leader, Shoko Asahara, goes into the dock on October 26, charged   with murder in the nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March in   which 11 people were killed and 5,500 others were injured.   Some 3,000 people lined up outside the Tokyo District Court hoping for   a place among the 56 seats reserved for the public, and hundreds of   reporters laid siege to the building.   Court officials said the crowd was the second largest since 3,900   turned up for the first day of the trial of former prime minister   Kakuei Tanaka in the Lockheed bribery scandal in 1983.   Aoyama graduated from the highly-regarded Kyoto University and in 1984   became Japan\\'s youngest lawyer at the time. He often appeared on   television to defend the sect, fluently portraying it as an innocent   and peaceable religious group that had been falsely accused.   The sect\\'s other spokesman, who was also a top media performer, was the   flamboyant Fumihiro Joyu, 32, who was arrested earlier this month.   Investigators told the court Wednesday the sect had produced at least   10 kilogrammes (22 pounds) of Sarin gas by February 1994, and four   months later released part of it in the alpine town of Matsumoto, in an   attack in which seven people were killed.   Aoyama, in his statement of contrition, said he had joined the sect   because he felt lost and needed a spiritual direction -- and found it   in the teachings of the bearded and nearly-blind Asahara.   \"I had been trying to reach Buddhist salvation,\" he said. \"I am now   completely determined never to do wrong again, and I have withdrawn   from the sect. I want to return to society.\"   Aoyama admitted to charges of attempted fraud, making false accusations   and sheltering Aum fugitives.   He also faces charges of libel against a fertilizer producer living   near the sect\\'s commune in the village of Kamikuishiki, central Japan.   The lawyer said he was ordered by Asahara to file a suit in January   charging the fertilizer producer had sprayed nerve gas on the sect\\'s   commune to kill followers.   After Aoyama was arrested on May 3, the Federation of Japanese Bar   Associations stripped him of his lawyer\\'s status.   Coinciding with the trials of Aum\\'s leaders, the government has stepped   up efforts to tighten control of religious groups by submitting a bill   to parliament to revise the nation\\'s religious laws.   Despite strong opposition from the Buddhist-backed opposition party,   the three-party ruling coalition intends to pass the bill during the   current parliament session which will end November 13.',\n",

       " 'training-1366': {'body': \"   streamlined version of its OS/2 operating system for personal computers   in another hopeful attempt to lessen the dominance of Microsoft Corp.'s   Windows system.   The company is readying print and radio advertising as well as   television spots and possibly a TV infomercial, said Keith Lindenburg,   spokesman for IBM's Personal Software Products division. Details of the   campaign are still under wraps, but Lindburg promised, ``It's going to   be one of the more aggressive campaigns for a software rollout at   IBM.''   IBM is scheduled to release the updated and slimmed-down version of   OS/2 in October. Code-named Warp, the program is designed to run fast   on a personal computer with four megabytes of random access memory --   half of the current version -- and has a number of improvements and   features designed to make it easier to use.   Officials are hoping the new OS/2 will do what previous versions could   not -- provide a credible challenge to Microsoft's Windows program as   the operating system of choice. Windows has been installed on   approximately 50 million desktop computers, compared to about 5 million   for OS/2.   Microsoft next year is planning a major new release of Windows,   currently called Chicago, which, like Warp, is a 32-bit, multitasking   system designed to run on four megabytes of RAM.   IBM is hoping that as Microsoft attempts to convert computer users to   the new system, customers will be up for grabs.   The company also is counting on Microsoft's recent antitrust settlement   with the Justice Department to open up computer manufacturers to the   idea of installing more OS/2 at the factory instead of Microsoft's   Windows. In the settlement, Microsoft agreed to stop certain pricing   practices that federal officials thought precluded manufacturers from   installing operating systems that compete with Windows.   ``We do see a window of opportunity,'' Lindenburg punned. He added that   IBM is talking with some of the top five computer manufacturers.   In a somewhat unusual move, IBM's marketing campaign will not be geared   to corporations. Warp's smaller memory requirements and ease-of-use   features should make it attractive to consumers, home businesses and   notebook computer users, so IBM plans to focus efforts there.   ``The consumer end user is a marketplace that's booming right now,''   Lindenburg said. ``The research tells us that's really an area that we   can tap into.''   Analysts say the new operating system is technically sound. But they   question IBM's ability to out-market Microsoft, especially in light of   previous failed attempts to sell OS/2, such as with the company's   sponsorship of college football's Fiesta Bowl.   ``I really think IBM has a good product,'' said Karl Wong, software   analyst for Dataquest Inc. ``But what they really need to do is go   beyond the idea that having a good product is all you need to do well.   Software is market-driven, and the winner is who has the better   marketing. Microsoft is one of the premier companies in terms of   marketing software.''   Although OS/2 will run older software applications designed for   Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems, the program will   continue to be plagued by a lack of applications written specifically   for OS/2, he said. Wong also questioned IBM's decision to target   consumers, a much smaller market than office users despite high growth   potential.   ``I think it's foolish to put your main thrust behind only one market   segment,'' he said.   Richard Freedman, product manager in Microsoft's personal operating   systems group, said OS/2 ``is like limburger cheese. No matter how much   you advertise it, most people just don't want it. And the few people   who do buy it, they say it doesn't smell too good.''   Freedman added that software applications written to run on Chicago   won't work on the new version of OS/2.   IBM plans to include several application programs with Warp, including   word processor, spreadsheet, charting and graphics, a Compuserve   information manager, fax program and software for connecting to the   Internet. The package will cost less than $100, Lindenburg said.   Wong says IBM could make inroads if the already-delayed Chicago system   is even later to reach stores, or if the new system is buggy or won't   run well on four megabytes of memory.   But he added that even big miscues by Microsoft would gain IBM little,   ``maybe 1 or 2 percent'' of the desktop operating system market, ``if   IBM can keep hammering it home and making incremental improvements'' to   OS/2.\",\n",

The 28-year-old right-hander, the 1993 AL Cy Young Award winner, was   10-9 last season with a 3.73 ERA. He was among the AL leaders in   innings, strikeouts, complete games and shutouts.   ``He's a top pitcher, a Cy Young winner once, who threw great last   year,'' New York general manager Gene Michael said Wednesday. ``He's a   great competitor, a proven winner.''   The White Sox received Keith Heberling, a promising 22-year-old pitcher   who ended last season in the Eastern League.   McDowell would become a restricted free agent if owners impose a salary   cap on Thursday, as is expected. He could sign an offer sheet with any   team but the Yankees would have 10 days to match any offer. Jim Abbott   of the Yankees is in a similar situation.   McDowell went to arbitration the last three years with the White Sox,   winning in 1993 and losing in 1992 and 1994. He was soured by the   experience and vowed last spring not to play with the White Sox in   1995.   ``He was the leader of our staff,'' White Sox manager Gene Lamont told   Chicago radio station WMVP. ``I don't think anybody things he's going   to be easy to replace. He's as good a pitcher as there is in baseball.   We just didn't think we could re-sign him.''   Michael said he is confident of signing McDowell, who made dlrs 5.3   million last season, the highest one-year deal ever for a pitcher.   ``We think we could do it correctly and come out with a player like   this,'' Michael said from Chicago, where owners and general managers   will meet Thursday. ``We like him for our staff if we can get him in   here. We have to make a qualifying offer first, which is 110 percent of   his contract.   In '93, McDowell won the Cy Young when he finished 22-10 with a 3.37   ERA. He is 91-58 lifetime with a 3.50 ERA, 49 complete games and 10   shutouts in 191 games, all with the White Sox.   McDowell had a rough start to the 1994 season, with his record at 2-7   and his ERA at 7.54 as of May 13. But over his last 10 starts, McDowell   went 7-2 with a 1.81 ERA, allowing just 17 earned runs over 84 2-3   innings. He threw three consecutive complete games to finish the   season.   McDowell would join a Yankees starting rotation featuring left-hander   Jimmy Key, who finished second in voting for the Cy Young,   right-handers Melido Perez and Scott Kamieniecki and young left-hander   Sterling Hitchcock.\",\n",

       " 'training-1567': {'body': \"   West Indies star batsman Brian Lara passed a fitness test Thursday,   guaranteeing he would play in the opening cricket Test match against   Australia starting Friday.   The 25-year-old Lara, who holds the world record Test and first-class   scores, has been nursing an injured hip since he missed the last of   five one-day international matches against Australia on March 18.   On Thursday, Lara practiced with no obvious discomfort.   ``Brian came through the session quite well and we are confident he is   fit enough to take his place in the team,'' manager Andy Roberts said.   Lara cut short a batting practice session Wednesday when, according to   Roberts, he ``felt a little discomfort after playing a particular   shot.''   Lara's presence in the West Indies team is a big confidence-booster as   he is widely regarded as the best batsman in the game and hit the only   hundred in the recent one-day internationals -- 139 in the third match   at the Queen's Park Oval in his native Trinidad and Tobago.   West Indies captain Richie Richardson, who had to miss the last four   one-day internationals after straining ligaments in his right shoulder   in the opening match March 8, came through both practice sessions with   no ill effects.   It will be Richardson's first Test since he led the West Indies against   England in Barbados last April. In July, doctors diagnosed him as   suffering from acute fatigue syndrome and advised him to take a   six-month break from the game. In the interim, he missed Test series   against India in India and against New Zealand in New Zealand.   The West Indies has not lost a Test series since it was beaten 1-0 by   New Zealand in New Zealand in 1980. It hasn't been beaten at home in   the Caribbean since it lost to Australia 2-0 in 1973.   The West Indies' emphatic 4-1 triumph in the one-day international   series; the ankle injury that has put Australia's leading fast bowler,   Craig McDermott, out of the series; and the indifferent form of key   Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne have further increased the West   Indies' chances.   But Richardson warned against complacency.   ``I'm very happy with that result but we're not going to relax and   believe that because we've won that series so easily it's going to be   the same with the Test matches,'' he said.   ``They seem a little bit tired,'' Richardson added. ``They've been   playing a lot of cricket but I'm sure that when the Tests start,   they're going to be rejuvenated and more motivated.''   The Australians completed a 3-1 victory over England in the Test series   in Australia that ended in early February and are generally rated as   the strongest challengers to the West Indies in cricket.   Australia's captain, Mark Taylor, said his team's morale was good in   spite of the defeat in the one-day series and the loss of McDermott.   ``We are at the point where things are happening,'' Taylor said. ``Our   players are fit, all the batsmen, except myself, have had a good   workout coming into the Test and we are ready to switch on.''   Barbados Cricket Association secretary Basil Matthews said a sellout   crowd of 14,000 was expected for the first three days -- including   about 700 Australian tourists who came for the first two Tests here and   in Antigua.   The second Test is in Antigua April 8-13, the third in Trinidad April   21-26 and the fourth and final in Jamaica April 29 to May 3.

The statement was a departure from the tradition of the office to stay   out of day-to-day politics, but reflected the gravity with which   Israeli leaders are viewing the spate of violence by Islamic militants   that has claimed 51 Israeli lives since Oct. 1.

       " 'training-1560': {'body': '   A senior US general criticised as \"unrealistic\" Tuesday a crucial   deadline set by the Dayton agreement for the removal of landmines from   Bosnia\\'s frontlines.   A deadline of midnight last Friday -- by which time the parties had to   remove dismantle or destroy all mines and explosive devices from the   zones of separation -- was not met.   \"Of course it fell behind schedule,\" General William Nash told   reporters after chairing a meeting of generals from Bosnia\\'s former   warring parties.   \"It was an unrealistic schedule with respect to clearing all the mines   here, but everybody is committing to get the job done,\" added Nash,   commando of the NATO-led peacekeeping force known as IFOR in   northeastern Bosnia.   Nash said a variety of matters had been discussed at the joint military   commission meeting, attended by Croat, Moslem and Serb military   commanders.   The ebullient, cigar-toting general brought his forceful personality to   bear on the former enemies, back-slapping and hand-clasping his way   through the assorted uniforms after the meeting, bringing smiles to   faces etched by war.   \"I would describe the meeting as productive, professional and I would   tell you that there were no major areas that we had big problems in,\"   said an upbeat Nash, describing cooperation between the parties and   IFOR as \"excellent.\"   \"We have no problems at all that we don\\'t see being resolved. The   biggest issue of course is clearing mines, and we all know that\\'s a big   challenge we must overcome.\"   The UN estimates that up to six million mines litter the country,   mainly along frontline areas.   Asked what guarantees he had received at the meeting that the mines   would be cleared, Nash said: \"they\\'re all working on it. Every day we   have people out trying to clear mines. They have withdrawn their forces   and they understand that the burden for peace is on their shoulders.\"   The mines continue to take a toll, however.   Four Danish soldiers were slightly injured when their Leopard tank hit   a mine near the northern town of Doboj on Tuesday morning, IFOR said.   They were airlifted to a Norwegian military hospital in Tuzla.   A Bosnian Croat soldier was killed while mine-clearing in the British   IFOR sector last week, IFOR spokesman Major Peter Bullock said, adding   that the warring parties had been \"generally cooperative\" in marking   and dismantling mines.   \"It\\'s a huge task given that there are 1,1OO kilometres of   confrontation line,\" said Bullock.   General Momir Talic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army\\'s Krajina   division, said it would take \"more than six months\" to clear the mines.   \"It is not realistic to expect the removal of mines in so short a time   after four years of war,\" he said.   The Serb general also said his forces would respect the next Dayton   deadline of \"D plus 45\" -- 45 days after the December 20 UN handover to   IFOR, or February 3. By that date, some territories are due to be   exchanged between the former warring parties.',\n",

       " 'training-0350': {'body': \"   Thailand has become a mecca for Hollywood producers looking for an   exotic setting, stunning landscapes and, in the case of Disney,   elephants roaming in real forests.   Once just a set for Vietnam War movies, the country is currently   hosting the filming of action flicks, ``The Quest'' and ``Cutthroat   Island.'' And Walt Disney Studios just wrapped up ``Dumbo Drop,'' a   dlrs 30-million movie set in Thailand's elephant-filled mountainous   north.   Moshe Diamant, producer of ``The Quest,'' said he chose Thailand as the   filming site because it ``captivated'' him.   ``China would have been cheaper but you can't beat Thailand _ good   crews and personnel at all levels. They're very reliable and nice to   work with,'' Diamant said. ``The weather's perfect, the scenery's   stunning.''   Diamant says that the studios aren't the only ones benefiting from the   increasing use of Thailand as the Hollywood of the East. He estimates   that 40 percent of the film's dlrs 35 million budget goes into the   community for extras, food, hotels, and souvenirs.   ``We're pumping a lot of money directly into the Thai economy,''   Diamant says from the set in Phuket, 690 kilometers (430 miles)   southwest of Bangkok.   Charlie Sungkawess, the Thai first assistant director on ``The Quest,''   has worked for some 30 Hong Kong and American films, such as ``Rambo   3,'' in which the opening was filmed in Thailand.   He had to turn down ``Cutthroat Island,'' to work on ``The Quest,''   directed and starred in by kick-boxing actor Jean-Claude Van Damme,   with Roger Moore, the former ``James Bond'' star.   ``My favorite was probably, `Air America,' with Mel Gibson; very   relaxed atmosphere, very good crew, no pressure,'' says Sungkawess,   during a break from the filming. He worked on ``Dumbo Drop'' for   several months before taking on ``The Quest.''   As he talks, ``Cutthroat Island,'' a dlrs 60 million epic of piracy in   the 1600s, also is being produced and directed by Renny Harlin in the   turquoise waters of Phuket and its thickly-forested national park. The   film stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine and Frank Langella.   International film-makers first began filming in Thailand, which   resembled Vietnam, to make Vietnam war movies. They were barred from   filming in the Communist country.   ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' with Robin Williams, ``Casualties of War''   with Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, as well as ``Heaven and Earth,''   directed by Oliver Stone, were all shot in Thailand.   ``The Killing Fields,'' about the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign in   Cambodia, also was filmed in Thailand because of government   restrictions, and a continuing civil war, in Cambodia.   But now Thailand is wanted more for itself than its resemblance to its   Indochinese neighbors. Last year, ``Mortal Kombat,'' a maga-bucks   Hollywood feature film, was shot on the lush tropical seashores of   Phuket.   ``Cutthroat Island,'' a Carolco production, is scheduled for summer   release, with ``The Quest'' by Universal, to open in the United States   and Europe at Christmas.   ``It's like a Christmas gift I want to give people,'' Van Damme said in   an interview in Phuket.   ``I think they'll like the movie; it has adventure, action, romance, a   lot of heart,'' he said. `` And, while it's cold outside, maybe even   snowing, they'll be on holiday in the theater, seeing the great   scenery, the beautiful ocean off Phuket ... the sunshine of the   tropics.''\",\n",

       " 'training-0351': {'body': \"   Investing   The number 654 has followed N. Anthony Rolfe around for more than 50   years, he says. He was assigned to an LST bearing that number as a   young naval officer in 1943, and he served on it for three years.   But in and out in three years is not the way this real-estate broker   and investor has operated as a civilian.   Last month, he concluded a new 15-year lease with Calvin Klein for a   20,000-square-foot showcase store in a building at 654 Madison Avenue,   at the northwest corner of 60th Street. Rolfe is the managing partner   in the ownership group.   The lease will put Calvin Klein on the same block as Barney's,   reinforcing the southern end of a high-fashion stretch of Madison   Avenue that extends at least as far as the Ralph Lauren store at 72nd   Street. Along the way one passes such names as Valentino, Giorgio   Armani, Versace, and Gianfranco Ferre. Coming soon will be Prada, a   leading leather-goods retailer, on the southeastern corner of 70th   Street, and Crate &AMP; Barrel, the home furnishings retailer, at the   northwest corner of 59th Street.   Rolfe's long tenure at 654 Madison Avenue and as the conversion sponsor   at Imperial House, a large East Side co-op, make the case for patience,   staying power and conservative financing as central elements of success   in Manhattan real-estate investment.   At Imperial House, he and the late Edward Sulzberger sponsored a   conversion under a noneviction plan in 1970. He sold apartments retail   -- to individual tenants or to outsiders for occupancy when he had a   vacancy -- but not in bulk to other investors.   ``It has taken me 23 years to sell 290 apartments,'' Rolfe said. ``We   still own 46.'' About 100 of the sales were to tenants after the   conversion took effect, made at various prices through the years.   He never pledged unsold shares to obtain new financing for other   acquisitions. When the building was sold to the co-op corporation, the   co-op received all the elements of the property -- the stores and the   garage as well as the apartments. They provided income to strengthen   the buiilding's finances, allowing it more resources for maintenance   and improvements, and thereby enhancing resale values.   ``It's no secret,'' Rolfe said. ``Success in a deal is at the buy. You   ask yourself, `Can I carry it in the worst possible situation?' Staying   power is the most important ingredient. You can't be overloaded with   debt. You can't be looking for a quick turnaround. You don't look for   liquidity.   ``Harry Helmsley used to say that when things went bad in the city in   the '70s the things he couldn't get rid of turned out to be the biggest   bonanzas.''   Rolfe, who is 70, was the brother-in-law as well as the partner of   Sulzberger, who for 50 years headed the firm of Sulzberger Rolfe Inc.   Sulzberger handled the management side of the business. He died in   1986. Four years later the company was sold to the Milstein family,   owner of Douglas Elliman Gibbons &AMP; Ives.   Rolfe was the senior sales broker, the main dealmaker. In 1958, he   represented Irving Brodsky, who was buying a small interest in the   operating lease to 654 Madison as a minority partner of Helmsley and   his associates. Eventually the Sulzberger-Rolfe interests bought out   the other partners.   For many years, Rolfe hoped to buy the land under the building -- the   fee position -- which would free the owner as operating lessee from   paying land rent. The fee was sold instead to a bank that was a tenant   in the building. When the tenant was acquired by another bank and   wanted to move, Rolfe released the bank -- Manufacturers &AMP; Traders   Trust Co., based in Buffalo, N.Y. -- from eight remaining years on its   lease as part of a deal to acquire the fee. The financial terms were   not disclosed.   ``Owning the fee is the name of the game,'' Rolfe said. ``It always   was. An operating leasehold is like owning a stock. The fee is a bond.   When inflation is going up you want the stock, and the bondholder is   stuck. But the day comes ... .'' His voice trailed off suggestively.   When ``the day comes'' for a co-op that happens to have been built or   converted on leased land, many co-op owners are not prepared for the   impact of a newly negotiated lease on their monthly maintenance   charges. Long-term land leases are subject to periodic rent   adjustments, sometimes as frequently as 10 years in leasehold co-ops,   though usually much longer in commercial leases. The rent negotiation   of renewals sometimes ends in a decision to arbitrate. The rent   increase may still be drastic.   At Imperial House, the Sulzberger and Rolfe families bought (and sold   to the co-op at the conversion) both the land and the building. The   29-story building consists of 378 apartments with stores on Third and   Lexington Avenues, with underground parking, on the full block between   68th and 69th Streets. The seller was a partnership of Fisher Brothers,   the building company, and Samuel Golding, a banker. Imperial House   opened as an unregulated rental in 1961, eight years before the   imposition of rent stabilization for postwar multifamily housing in New   York City. Until 1969, only prewar housing was regulated.   Rent stabilization led many investor-builders to withdraw from rental   development. Fisher Brothers was one of them. The Sulzberger-Rolfe   group bought the property with the intention of converting it. Having   paid a cash price of $12,000 a room for the 2,000 rooms, Rolfe said,   they were hoping to resell to tenants at $15,000 to $20,000 a room.   But only 50 of the 378 tenants initially would buy. With rent   stabilization in effect, the sponsors decided to pursue a non-eviction   conversion, selling vacancies and also selling to tenants if and when   they decided to buy. Renewal leases were offered to renters who   remained.   That meant 10 years of cash losses for the sponsor, since rents for   unsold apartments were insufficient to cover the sponsor's carrying   costs on those apartments. After that, sales income exceeded the   maintenance shortfall, and at a growing rate, Rolfe said. ``We were   home free,'' he said.   In 1970, the buyer of a 2,700-square-foot, 7-room apartment in the   tower portion of the building (with 3{ baths and 3 bedrooms) would have   paid a cash price of $123,000. Twelve years later, in 1982, three such   apartments sold. The prices were $625,000, $675,000, and $750,000.   In 1986 two sold, one for $1.6 million and the other for $1.25 million.   In 1992 one was sold for $1.45 million. None in the line have been sold   since.   At Imperial House the tower starts at the 21st floor. In the base,   apartments are also large, with generous closet space. Original buyers   in 1971 paid a cash price of $69,614 for a 1,756-square-foot five-room   apartment on the 16th floor. The same apartment resold in 1981 for   $360,000 and for $475,000 three years later. This year, the same   apartment two floors lower sold for $580,000.   The underlying first mortgage on the building, allocated to these   rooms, left shareholders with a mortgage burden amounting to $9,000 to   $10,000 a room.   Investment by the co-op itself, and by individual owners in their   apartments over the years, has helped sustain values. ``A tremendous   amount of money was spent by the co-op on preventive maintenance,   electrical system, air-conditioning and the like,'' Rolfe said.   Maintenance payments sustain an unusually large staff of 60. There are   eight elevators, seven of them manned.   On Madison Avenue, the Calvin Klein store will be on three levels plus   a mezzanine on the double-height first floor, formerly used for   banking. Company spokesmen declined to discuss the lease or how the   space would be used, but the expectation is that it will carry Calvin   Klein's full line of men's and women's clothing and also its furniture.   Most likely it won't carry the products that are merely licensed to use   the Calvin Klein name, said C. Bradley Mendelson of Edward S. Gordon   Co., who was the broker in the lease. ``Not the underwear or the   jeans,'' he said. ``Not the socks.''\",\n",

       " 'training-0356': {'body': \"   A brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari   funneled more than dlrs 300,000 to pay for the killing of a top   political figure, Mexican prosecutors said in court papers made public   Thursday.   The allegations were made as part of an 800-page filing by prosecutors   who seek to extradite the victim's brother, Mario Ruiz Massieu, a   former prosecutor who is being held in the United States on a currency   violation charge.   Ruiz Massieu is accused of blocking the investigation into his own   brother's killing, steering the probe away from the president's   brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, who has been charged in the killing.   Ruiz Massieu has denied the charges.   He has told prosecutors that he had informed then-President Salinas de   Gortari early in the investigation that his brother had been implicated   by witnesses, according to the papers.   He said he had told the president that several people interviewed about   the assassination had mentioned Raul Salinas and ``there was a need to   bring him in,'' according to the papers.   The papers, though, do not state that Carlos Salinas de Gortari had   covered-up the killing.   The papers provide the first specifics of the case against Ruiz Massieu   and another prosecutor, Jorge Anastacio Stergios Gomez, who directly   supervised the inquiry into the death of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.   The Sept. 28, 1994, shooting death of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in   Mexico City was one of a series of assassinations that rocked Mexico in   recent months. He was former secretary-general of the Institutional   Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico the past 66 years.   According to the papers, Raul Salinas de Gortari funneled 1 million   pesos (more than dlrs 300,000) to Congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha to   arrange the killing. Munoz is a fugitive whose wife believes he is   dead.   In recent depositions, some of those already convicted in the   assassination accuse Mario Ruiz Massieu and Gomez of intimidation and   torture to keep the name of the Raul Salinas out of the probe,   according to the papers.   Mario Ruiz Massieu had quit as deputy attorney general in November,   charging that senior officials in the governing party had blocked his   efforts to solve the murder, which he said was motivated by efforts to   eliminate a party reformer.   He left Mexico a day after being interviewed by Mexican prosecutors and   was arrested days later at Newark International Airport on the currency   charge.   The other prosecutor, Stergios Gomez, is also considered a fugitive   after an arrest warrant was issued for him May 3.   Six accomplices and the gunman in the shooting have been sentenced to   terms ranging from 37 years to 50 years.\",\n",

The prime minister also congratulated U.S. Vice-President Al Gore for   his election victory, praising him as \"a great friend of Israel for   many years.\"   Netanyahu said that he expected Clinton\\'s re-election would make it   easier to ensure the continuation of the Middle East peace process,   while believing that the much-expected U.S. pressure will not be   applied.   \"We are looking forward to working with the new, old if you want,   American Administration on the process of extending peace in the   (Middle East) area. We have been doing this consistently over the last   few months, and we intend to do it in the coming days, as well as   coming months and years,\" he asserted.   The hardline premier repeated the accusation of the Palestinian   Authority for delaying the signing of an agreement on Israeli troop   redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.   He claimed that U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, originally expected to   return to Israel today, postponed his trip because the Palestinians did   not give the go-ahead signals.   Ross returned home last week after the failure to secure a Hebron deal,   despite three weeks of intensive mediation.   Talking about Israeli-Syrian tension, Netanyahu said Israel viewed   Syria\\'s message as a \"serious commitment\", which was sent through the   U.S., Russia and France clarifying that its troop movements were purely   defensive.   Once again, Netanyahu called on Syria to resume peace negotiations with   Israel.   He said that Syria and other parties in the Arab world should   understand that \"the date of the American elections does not materially   change their need and responsibility to enter negotiations.\"   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk confirmed that the   Clinton government would continue playing the role of facilitator in   the peace talks, ruling out any changes in the U.S. policy regarding   its involvement in the peace process.   Indyk believed an Israeli-Palestinian deal was imminent. \"The issues   can be resolved, and we are close to the resolution. But it is up to   the parties themselves to make those decisions,\" he said.   The ambassador also said that the Clinton government would maintain its   aid to Israel at the current level in order to \"minimize the risk of   the peace process.\"   Currently Israel receives 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of annual economic   aid from the U.S. in addition to 1.8 billion dollars of military   assistance.',\n",

       " 'training-0190': {'body': '   Christian Lacroix went back to his roots with his summer ready-to-wear   show on Sunday.   The collection glowed with the hot pinks and mimosa yellows of his   native Provence.   It was a return to the distinctive touches which became his hallmark   when he opened the house back in 1987 -- his clever way with patchwork,   his penchant for toreador jackets and his reworkings of the traditional   costume of Arles, which he remembered from Sundays in his childhood.   Many of these elements have rather dropped out of sight in recent   collections.   He opened with 1970s nostalgia, wide pants and blazers, mixing checks   and floral prints, alternating panels of horizontal and vertical   stripes, and embroidering arabesques and provencal motifs down sleeves   or across the yokes of jackets.   Bucking the current trend towards the simple, pared down and unadorned   look, his daywear was a riot of colour, in unashamedly luxurious   fabrics like damask and satin, overlaid with lace or threaded with   lurex.   Evening sheaths had rhinestone zips or giant glittering jewel buttons   in the plunging neckline.   There were several takes on the Arlesienne, with giant shawl collars in   white crepe georgette and stiff skirts standing out almost horizontally   from the waist. One version in ivory faille was covered entirely with a   delicate top layer of black lace. In another the shawl collar was   reduced to a wisp of black chiffon.   Lacroix\\' way with lace has become a signature of the house. For next   season he has used it to trim the spiral flounces of cocktail frocks,   to insert trains into the back of evening gowns or turned it into   little cap sleeves on otherwise plain satin sheaths.   In total contrast, a second Lacroix show this week promises to be just   as much of an occasion: the designer is launching his own line of   jeans.   \"Fashion is not a museum,\" he insists. For him jeans are as significant   in changing the course of fashion history as the Chanel jacket.   Lacroix had the idea of starting his own line in jeans while watching   bull-fighting in the Camargue. \"If you close your eyes in the arena,   you find yourself in a sea of blue, because everybody is wearing   jeans.\"   The new line consists of around 120 designs in denim, linen and satin,   with many of the characteristic Lacroix touches, like unexpected   combinations of Hawaiian flowers with futuristic hologram prints. The   range will cover everything from stretch jeans to biker\\'s jackets and   waistcoats inspired by the 17th century borrowed from Lacroix\\' couture   collection.   The line is being manufactured in Italy by the industrialist Gilmar and   is expected to generate a turnover of 60 to 70 million francs (12 to 15   million dollars) in the first year, with 200,000 items going on sale at   500 outlets.   Prices will be between 350 and 1,700 francs.   After a rocky first year, the house, which belongs to the world luxury   leader LMVH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), is expected to break even in   1996 or 1997. The ready-to-wear luxury line will have an anticipated   turnover this year of 120 million francs, around the same as for the   new diffusion line, Bazaar. Lacroix has his eyes set on the expanding   market in Asia and will open two boutiques in Beijing and Shanghai in   summer 1996.',\n",

Speaking on Monday at the 5th annual coffee conference for stakeholders   in the northern town of Moshi, the prime minister urged the   participants to boost coffee production per unit area by using   expertise, inputs and planting new seedlings to attain the projected   70,000 tons of annual output by the year 2005.   He stressed that increased coffee production was crucial in the fight   against poverty, adding that a strong agricultural sector can help   driving growth in other sectors.   Sumaye told the stakeholders in coffee business, government policy   makers and financial institution officials that the liberalization of   coffee marketing did not mean compromising on the quality of the crop.   There was need to improve Tanzania's coffee quality to the highest   degree so as to face stiff competition in international markets, Sumaye   noted, because most of produced coffee was marketed abroad.   Coffee has been the major export in Tanzania's foreign trade for the   last two to three decades with an annual earning of 400 million U.S.   dollars.   Currently standing at 50,000 tons, the annual coffee output in Tanzania   has slumped in recent years because of bad weather conditions and   mostly, economic factors.\",\n",

       " 'training-1916': {'body': '   Tanzania closed its border with Burundi Friday to halt tens of   thousands of Rwandan refugees fleeing camps in northern Burundi after   murderous clashes between rival Hutu and Tutsi communities.   An official with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Dar   es Salaam, contacted by telephone, said the government had sent troops   to seal off the border and that Tanzania\\'s minister of defence was in   the area coordinating operations.   A spokesman for President Ali Hassan Mwinyi told AFP the government had   not announced the border closure, but was not denying it.   The UN refugee commissioner, Sadako Ogata, issued a statement in Geneva   calling on all governments in the region \"to respect the principle of   safe asylum.\"   She also urged the international community \"to support the efforts made   by the countries of the region to meet their obligations.\"   The exodus from the camps in northern Burundi started Tuesday after a   machete, knife and grenade attack on one of the camps that left 12 dead   and 22 wounded, and ethnic clashes in Bujumbura that resulted in up to   500 deaths.   That prompted the flight of tens of thousands of Burundian Hutus and   Zaireans toward Zaire and the precipitate departure for \"holidays\" of   several hundred expatriates.   The clashes have sharpened fears that the tiny central African nation   may plunge into full-scale civil war on the scale of the fighting in   neighbouring Rwanda last year, when Hutu soldiers and militiamen   butchered more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus before   being defeated by Tutsi rebels.   Both countries have approximately the same ethnic mix: 85 percent Hutu   and 14 percent Tutsi. In Burundi, the Tutsis controlled the army and   government until 1993 when a first ever Hutu president was installed in   office.   Some 45,000 of the 200,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi were on the road   between the camps and the Tanzanian border Friday, UNHCR Nairobi   spokesman Peter Kessler told AFP.   The refugees -- all Hutus -- were carrying meagre rations on their   heads and sleeping by the roadside, he said, adding that for the   elderly and the infirm it was a four-day trek.   Some 3,200 had crossed over into Tanzania by early Friday, before the   border was sealed, Kessler said. The UNHCR official in the Tanzanian   capital added that it was likely some others would be able to \"sneak   through\" because of the length of the border.   In all, more than two million Rwandan refugees are living in camps in   neighbouring countries, 590,000 of them in Tanzania.   Relief workers had been planning to direct the latest wave to   Tanzania\\'s Kitali camp, close to the border, set up early this year to   house 28,000 refugees from Burundi and 12,000 from Rwanda.   The medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres reported meanwhile that it   was setting up an ambulance system to pick up the weak and the sick,   and was establishing health posts every 15 kilometres (nine miles)   along the refugee route.   \"No one knows exactly how many more refugees will leave the camps, but   we can certainly expect thousands more,\" said coordinator Mady Diallo   before the news came that the border was closed.   Kessler said earlier that UNHCR field workers were at the camps in   Burundi trying to persuade people to stay, or at least to leave in an   orderly manner.   \"The field workers are trying to tell them they are there to monitor   their safety and will stand by them,\" he said.   One of the seven camps, Mugara, was now completely empty, he added.   Rations in the camps in Burundi and neighbouring countries have already   been slashed by around half as a result of \"donor fatigue,\" leading   relief agencies to warn of impending famine.   The UN World Food Programme alone has a shortfall of 127 million   dollars and 236,000 tonnes of food for its programmes in the area for   the rest of the year, but it said Friday that donors \"appear to be   responding very favourably\" to a new appeal launched on March 10.   The refugees are receiving food producing only 1,000 calories a day,   Kessler said, but it appeared most of those fleeing had waited for   rations to be distributed before leaving.   The Organisation of African Unity and French-speaking states have both   decided to send mediating missions to Burundi.   The UN Security Council warned extremists they could face an   international tribunal, but made no move toward sending in UN troops,   as they did in Rwanda, where some 5,500 Blue Helmets remain.',\n",

       " 'training-1171': {'body': \"   two years is the most immediate result of the Republican capture of   Congress.   The midterm elections confirm the verdict of the 1992 presidential   election: success abroad, be it in Iraq or Haiti, is scarcely worth a   vote at the polls.   If President Bill Clinton plans to make up for his loss of control over   the domestic agenda by a flurry of activity overseas he will have his   work cut out.   With the possible exception of a second round with Saddam Hussein,   voters want to keep American involvement in other countries to a   minimum.   The same mood pervades Washington. It is not that the end to American   participation in implementing the arms embargo on Bosnia was   unexpected. But by casually leaking the details to the U.S. press last   week before briefing European ministers, the administration underlined   the priority it gives to domestic affairs.   Among Republicans there are signs of the same flip tone, with Senator   Robert Dole recommending U.S. troops leave Haiti by Thanksgiving next   week.   After a defeat as thumping as that suffered by President Clinton last   week it may be too much to expect anybody in the administration to care   about the ripples it is causing abroad. The Republicans also are high   on the euphoria of victory.   But the defeated supporters of the military regime in Haiti, still the   largest armed force in the country if the U.S. troops are removed, may   well take Dole's recommendation as a sign that they should keep their   weapons oiled.   The first real clash between Clinton and the new order in Congress is   expected to come over the GATT world trade talks.   In a letter to the President, the incoming chairman of the Senate   Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms, asked him to delay a   vote on the pact until next year.   ``If you will agree to this,'' says Helms, ``I can assure you that it   will have an exceedingly positive effect on my making certain that the   administration's position on all foreign policy matters during the   104th Congress will be considered fairly and fully.''   Threats do not come much blunter than this. But Clinton cannot really   afford to delay. The agreement, between 123 countries, took 12 years to   negotiate and any changes would kill the pact.   The White House may also consider it in its interests to push ahead   with GATT because it is an issue on which Republicans are so plainly   divided.   The new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, favors it, while Dole, the   majority leader in the Senate, is on the fence. Nothing would raise   Clinton's spirits more than a serious Republican split.   The Republicans may also be divided on how far to try to change   Clinton's supportive policy on Russia.   President Boris Yeltsin has already said he fears U.S.-Russian   relations may deteriorate. The priority given to Russia by Strobe   Talbot, the Deputy Secretary of State, will be hard to maintain.   In the distribution of aid, Helms and the Republicans are likely to   push for more money for the non-Russian republics and less for the   Russians. They may also be more antagonistic to Moscow over territorial   disputes, notably over control of the Caspian oil fields.   At the center of Republican strategy is a determination not to let   Clinton win any victories that may strengthen his hand in the run-up to   the 1996 presidential election.   His successes in Haiti, North Korea and Northern Ireland in the past   few months did him little good in the polling booth but they would   probably have been impossible without a Democratic Congress.   Policy on Bosnia may not, at the end of the day, change that much. But   it will be more difficult for Clinton to fudge, by gestures of   solidarity with the Bosnians that change nothing. And if anything goes   wrong, Republicans will want him to carry the blame.   Nor is it just Republicans nipping at his heels that will cramp   Clinton's never very expansive style.   The extent of his electoral defeat is so great that he will be seen as   a lame duck president by the leaders of every country with which he   deals. He will find it difficult to make policy decisions look   convincing where they do not have bipartisan support.   If Clinton really had carried out a distinctively liberal foreign   policy in the past two years, as the Republicans alleged in the   election campaign, then he would now be in real trouble. But his   radicalism was always overstated both by himself and his opponents.   The Republicans may want to smother any signs of Clinton taking the   initiative in foreign affairs in the next two years, but there was   little sign of his doing so anyway.\",\n",

Then I improved a little bit and I played much better in the third set   and in the fourth I had some chances and some break points, but Albert   was the better player.   \"Losing the first two sets meant I lost a lot of confidence and then a   lot of courage, but there will be other finals for me.\"   Costa settled quickly into the match and found his length and direction   easier than his 22-year-old opponent, who had been many people\\'s   favourite for the title.   He broke twice in the first set to take it 6-1 in just 21 minutes when   Ferrero hit a forehand long.   Ferrero, bidding for his seventh career title, had his concentration   disturbed by a 20-minute rain delay after only two games and his   normally reliable forehand, so destructive in his earlier wins over   Andre Agassi and Marat Safin, completely deserted him.   The first set statistics told a tale of woe for Ferrero - he hit 14   unforced errors compared to just eight for Costa and just one winner to   Costa\\'s 10.   Things got progressively worse in the second set as Costa, who knocked   out triple champion Gustavo Kuerten in the fourth round and last year\\'s   runner-up Alex Corretja in the semi-final, enjoyed three breaks to win   it 6-0 in just 22 minutes.   The conclusion of that set meant Costa, who had gone into the match   with a 2-2 career record against Ferrero, had won 11 games in a row   since the rain break.   Ferrero hit 13 unforced errors to Costa\\'s five in the second set and a   pitiful four winners.   However Ferrero temporarily stopped the rot in the third set when he   won the first game on his own serve before achieving a service break on   his first break point of the match to go ahead 2-0.   Costa broke straight back before Ferrero found some resilience by   saving four break points in the fifth game to edge ahead 3-2.   With the support of most of the 15,000 people watching on Philippe   Chatrier Court, Ferrero took the third set 6-4 when Costa could only   net an attempted drop shot.   It was an impressive recovery by Ferrero, playing in his first final   after being a semi-finalist here for the last two years, and the third   set statistics made happier reading as he hit 19 winners compared to   Costa\\'s nine while he also began to find his range with his first   service - 71 percent success compared to 53 percent in the second set.   However, Costa reimposed his authority quickly in the fourth set going   up an early break to lead 2-1 as Ferrero saw a rasping forehand hit the   tape and fall back agonisingly on his side.   Ferrero battled back to level at 3-3 before Costa returned the   compliment to lead 4-3 and then held to love for 5-3.   He wasted one match point in the next game but took the title when   Ferrero, who only managed four winners in the fourth set,   double-faulted.',\n",

Fellow Deputies,   As requested by the State Council, I shall now make a report to this   session on the implementation of the 2000 Plan for National Economic   and Social Development and on the Draft 2001 Plan for National Economic   and Social Development. This is presented to you for your examination   and approval and for comments and suggestions from members of the   National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative   Conference. I. Implementation of the 2000 Plan for National Economic   and Social Development The people of all ethnic groups in China worked   hard together during the past year under the correct leadership of the   Chinese Communist Party, scoring notable achievements in national   economic and social development. The economy as a whole took an   important turn for the better as it entered a beneficial cycle. The   plan was satisfactorily implemented.   The national economy continued to grow rapidly and there was continuous   improvement in the quality of growth and in economic performance. In   2000, China's GDP hit 8.9404 trillion yuan, representing an increase of   8% over the previous year, up by 0.9 percentage points. The overall   fall in prices was arrested and prices became stable, with consumer   prices rising by 0.4%. Total profits of state-owned and large non-state   industrial enterprises reached 426.2 billion yuan, an increase of 86.2%   over the preceding year, with profits of state-owned enterprises and   enterprises with the controlling share held by the state amounting to   239.2 billion yuan, an increase of 140%.

       " 'training-0991': {'body': '   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday credited his   government for compelling Palestinians delay statehood declaration.   He added that Israel will continue to oppose any unilateral declaration   of a Palestinian state in the future.   At a crowded news conference in his office, Netanyahu said Palestinian   National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat backed down from a plan to   declare statehood on Tuesday because \"he understands that we will   respond very firmly.\"   Flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Moshe   Arens, he said, for the last four years, Israel has been telling Arafat   not to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally. \"Now he wisely backed   off,\" Netanyahu said.   Arafat has said in the past that the Palestinians have the right to   declare an independent state on May 4, the date by which Israel and the   Palestinians are supposed to have reached a permanent agreement   according to the Oslo accords.   But the international community has urged him to hold off such a move   since it might destroy the already troubled peace process and drive   Israeli voters to elect a hard-line government to power in the May 17   elections.   The Palestinian Central Council, a 124-member Palestine Liberation   Organization leadership body, decided last week to postpone a decision   over statehood proclamation until after the Israeli elections.   However, Netanyahu pointed out the postponement was only temporary and   Arafat has left the door open for a new declaration.   \"I want to make it clear that we\\'ll continue to oppose any actions in   defiance of the treaties we have signed,\" Netanyahu said. These   unilateral actions are \"unacceptable and illegal,\" he added.   \"For the sake of the Palestinians, for the sake of peace and for the   sake of our common future, it is in the interests of the Palestinians   not to declare a state unilaterally on May 4 or any day at all,\" he   said.   The Israeli government has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank   still under its control if the Palestinians declare a state   unilaterally.   Sharon, the leading hawkish minister, reiterated this position at the   news conference.   Netanyahu added that if such a declaration is made, Israel would also   bar Israeli individuals or corporates from investing in the Palestinian   areas or demand Palestinian compensation for financial benefit it has   enjoyed from Israeli investment.   The prime minister denied that the tightening Israeli control over   Jerusalem, including demolition of Arab houses, confiscation of   Palestinian residencies and closure of Palestinian institutes, is also   a unilateral action banned by the Oslo agreements.   \"The status of Jerusalem, as it stands now--under fully Israeli   sovereignty--, will be maintained until it is decided otherwise (in   future agreements with the Palestinians),\" he said.   Therefore, he said, Israel is not violating the status quo of Jerusalem   and will \"act to ensure the continuance of Israel\\'s sovereignty over   the city.\"   The fate of Jerusalem, over which the Palestinians also claim   sovereignty, is supposed to be negotiated in the final-status talks,   which should have begun by May 1996 according to Oslo accords, but has   never happened.   Netanyahu is running a neck-and-neck campaign with One Israel leader   Ehud Barak in the runup to the May 17 elections. He has charged that   Barak will not stand as firmly as he does against a Palestinian state.   The opposition lashed out at Netanyahu over what they called his   attempt to turn a diplomatic failure into a victory, describing the   convening of the news conference is \"nothing but election propaganda.\"   One Israel legislator Shlomo Ben-Ami said as a matter of fact, it is   Arafat who has gained international support for his postponement of a   declaration of statehood.   Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai said the Palestinians had agreed   to put off a unilateral declaration when they signed the Wye agreement   in Washington last October.',\n",

A spokeswoman for Bolger said Tuesday that Chinese concerns \"had been   noted\" but the meeting would go ahead.   New Zealand maintains that Bolger and Foreign Minister Don McKinnon   will see the Dalai Lama in his capacity as a religious figure.   Australian Prime Minister John Howard has yet to confirm whether he   will meet the Tibetan leader, who arrives there Saturday for a two-week   tour.   Confirmation of the Bolger meeting came as the Dalai Lama was greeted   by indigenous Maoris and Buddhists as he arrived in Wellington Tuesday   for a four-day visit.   Soon after his arrival at Wellington Airport, the Dalai Lama, 61, was   given a traditional welcome at a tribal meeting place, known as a   marae, where he and Maori elders discussed problems common to Tibet and   to New Zealand\\'s indigenous people.   The Chinese government regards the Dalai Lama, a Nobel laureate, not as   Tibet\\'s spiritual leader but as a political exile.   China regularly protests when any country hosts the Dalai Lama.   In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in Wellington said the Dalai Lama\\'s   visit to New Zealand represented interference in China\\'s internal   affairs.   It said Tibet was an integral part of China.   \"The Dalai Lama is not purely a religious personage but a political   exile who engages in political activities aimed at disrupting national   unity.   \"The Chinese government and people are resolutely against his visit to   New Zealand in whatever capacity and under whatever reason, to conduct   activities aimed at separating the motherland,\" it said.   The Chinese foreign ministry issued a statement last month putting   pressure on Australia not to hold \"any official engagement\" with the   Dalai Lama.   The statement was issued following reports that Howard had been advised   by foreign office experts against meeting the Dalai Lama to avoid   souring already strained relationships with China.   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has agreed to a private meeting with   the Dalai Lama who is visiting from September 14-29 on his third trip   since 1982.

Late Tuesday NASA had considered holding a sixth spacewalk to check a   tracking device allowing the telescope to orient itself toward a   particular celestial object. But engineers decided it was unnecessary.   At the end of their last walk, during which they reinforced parts of   Hubble\\'s insulation cover, astronauts Mark Lee and Steve Smith tidied   up the shuttle\\'s cargo bay.   Lee and Smith patched up some tears in the outer covering of the   telescope using wire and clips as makeshift bandages.   \"You have done a superb job,\" said a NASA official back in Houston,   Texas, after the two astronauts returned to the shuttle ending a five   hour, 17 minute spacewalk.   When the crew of the Discovery first began to service the telescope   February 13, they noticed nicks and tears in its insulation caused by   temperature extremes in its orbit around the earth.   Four improvised patches were applied during the fourth spacewalk early   Monday, but a fifth outing was deemed necessary to complete the task,   replacing insulation covers to some of the Hubble\\'s lower compartments.   It was the second time the Hubble telescope was visited by the shuttle   after it was placed in orbit, also by the Discovery, in late 1990. In   1993 astronauts corrected a faulty lens on the Hubble.   Late Tuesday, Steve Hawley is set to seize Hubble with Canadian-made   mechanical arms and disengage it from the special rotating platform it   has rested on during the operations.   The telescope is then set to be lifted above the shuttle and released   before Discovery slowly drifts away.   The ground crew has run tests and verified that most of the instruments   aboard Hubble work. But NASA must wait several weeks before astronomers   will know if the two major additions to Hubble -- a spectrometer and a   spectrograph -- are functioning properly.   Hubble is set to be released about 15 kilometers (10 miles) higher than   its previous altitude. Discovery will place it 580 kilometers (360   miles) above the Earth so that it can wait the next mission without   being pulled into the upper layers of the atmosphere and destroyed.   Discovery took off for its 10-day mission February 11 at Cape   Canaveral, Florida. It is expected to return there for a predawn   landing -- the ninth in the US space shuttle program -- on Friday.',\n",

       " 'training-0285': {'body': \"   Counterintelligence agents for the past three years have been   monitoring the activities of a Japanese religious sect with possible   links to a nerve gas attack in Tokyo, an official said Thursday.   The service began investigating the Moscow branch of Aum Shinri Kyo   soon after the group began regular radio broadcasts in 1992, Federal   Counterintelligence Agency spokesman Vladimir Tomarovsky said.   ``It appeared that many young people were affected by their preaching.   Some suffered serious health damage, others severe mental disorders,''   he said.   ``When it became clear that we were dealing with a large-scale problem,   rather than an isolated case, we sent our materials to Russia's chief   prosecutor, who opened a criminal investigation,'' he said.   Japanese police are investigating the group's possible links to   Monday's attack in the Tokyo subway which killed at least 10 people and   sickened 5,000.   Tomarovsky said he had no grounds to suspect the Moscow branch of   planning any similar terrorist activity.   Aum Shinri Kyo, whose name means Sublime Truth, has six centers in   Moscow and a branch in the southern city of Vladikavkaz. It claim more   than 30,000, members, but the number could not be independently   verified.   Its twice-daily 25-minute broadcasts on Radio Mayak were stopped   Wednesday out of sympathy for victims of the Tokyo attack.   Leaders of the Moscow branch held a news conference Thursday to deny   brainwashing and ill-treatment of members. ``We are opening our center   to you, to show that we do not preach violence,'' said the branch's   Japanese leader, who identified himself only as Juyu.   He spoke in a large room with drab brown walls adorned with portraits   of sect leader Shoko Asahara. About two dozen members, mostly in their   20s, attended the conference.   Natasha Gromachikhina, 28, said she left her mother and young daughter   to come to Moscow from Naberezhnye Chelny on the Volga to study the   ``teaching.''   ``I heard the radio broadcasts, I was attracted by the music,'' she   said. ``Then, I listened to the words and thought the teaching was so   clear and simple, and I came here to study it.''   Roman Miroshenko, 24, said, ``if you want to be released, you must get   rid of all that ties you down, including your possessions.'' Before he   could continue, an older member told him to go to another room.   According to investigators, new members are forced to renounce their   parents and to turn over all possessions to the sect, then ordered to   pray intensively day and night.   Dmitry Saprykin, a branch leaders, claimed members were free to come   and go, and funds came from ``voluntary donations,'' made by followers.\",\n",

       " 'training-0286': {'body': '   US Vice President Al Gore gave an upbeat assessment of his   groundbreaking visit to Beijing Wednesday and said Chinese President   Jiang Zemin\\'s state visit to Washington was all-set for the autumn.   \"Our discussions were productive, friendly, searching and above all   wide-ranging...and proof positive of the commitment of Washington and   Beijing to expanding their relationship,\" Gore told a media briefing.   After meetings with Premier Li Peng and Jiang he confirmed the Chinese   president would travel to Washington in the autumn and said final   preparations for the visit could now get underway.   The main purpose of Gore\\'s landmark visit to Beijing was to prepare an   exchange of state visits by US President Bill Clinton and Jiang at the   end of 1997 and early 1998 which would cap the current thaw in   relations.   But the two sides also discussed three major outstanding issues in the   often-troubled relationship -- allegations that China planned to   influence US policy with political contributions, China\\'s treatment of   dissidents and continued trade obstacles to China\\'s markets.   \"I made it very clear that this (illegal contribution) would be very   serious indeed\" if proven to be true, Gore said, adding that Li had   himself raised the question and repeated Chinese denials.   However, Gore also underlined that \"this issue should not affect the   Sino-US relationship,\" in a clear attempt to prevent one single issue   from clouding the whole relationship, as has frequently occured in the   past.   Gore is the most senior US official to visit Beijing since the 1989   crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations sent ties plummeting. After a   slow recovery, a culmination of the issues of Taiwan, human rights and   trade then sent relations into freefall in early 1995.   Only in November did the two sides finally agree to put the   relationship on a more even footing and work for the development of   overall ties.   On the thorny issue of human rights, which has threatened to derail   ties on a number of occasions, Gore said that China\\'s top leadership   had been more \"receptive\" on human rights issues during his two days of   meetings.   Responses from Jiang and Li were \"better than it has been in the past.   I think we are finding ways to communicate more effectively with   Chinese leaders on this topic,\" Gore said, adding that specific cases   had been raised during the meetings.   \"I repeated President Clinton\\'s message that we seek real progress on   human rights, not confrontation,\" Gore said.   But he warned that Washington would not roll over on the issue, saying:   \"On these issues America\\'s voice would not and will not be muted.\"   On trade, both Jiang and Li gave assurances that Beijing would take   further measures to open its market to US exports and reduce the large   US trade deficit, and the government earlier showed such intentions by   awarding 2.2 billion dollars of contracts to US firms.   \"There are still serious and systemic obstacles to American companies,\"   Gore said, adding that he \"did not pull any punches\" on the topic.   Citing a US trade deficit with China of 39.5 billion dollars, Gore said   discussions about the two countries\\' methods for calculating the trade   balance went into significant detail.   But \"there is no disagreement that it (the deficit) is large and that   it is growing,\" he said.   However, two senior US congressman visiting Hong Kong gave a clear   indication that the deep divisions between Beijing and Washington were   a long way from being healed.   Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House of Representatives, warned \"much of   the world will be watching over the next year\" to see whether China   would meet its pledge to give Hong Kong autonomy under Beijing\\'s   sovereignty.   Separately, Douglas Bereuter, chairman of the house sub-committee on   Asia and Pacific affairs, told reporters China would be shunned by US   investors if it broke its vows to Hong Kong.   Their comments came only hours after Beijing\\'s official   English-language China Daily newspaper condemned the Hong Kong   Reversion Bill, recently passed by the House of Representatives, which   calls for the US to unleash economic sanctions if Beijing violates its   promises.   It said the Hong Kong Reversion Bill was \"wanton interference in   China\\'s internal affairs,\" which revealed \"once again, the ugly   hegemonic mentality of some members of the US Congress who want to lord   it over the world.\"',\n",

The Third International Conference on the Marine Biology of the South   China Sea opened here Monday, which is a venue for scientists to extend   their cooperation on the physical and biological study on the body of   water. The South China Sea, with an area of some 2.25 million sq km,   has a high research value for its floristic and faunistic diversity.   According to the organizer, this year\\'s meeting is more focusing on the   ecological conservation and protection of the Sea compared with the two   previous conferences -- one was held in Hong Kong in 1990 and the other   in Guangzhou in 1993.   One of the main themes addressed at the current conference is coastal   zone management and conservation of the biological resources of the   South China Sea, said Professor Brian Morton, chairman of the   organizing committee.   He listed a number of problems facing marine biology in the South China   Sea, such as rising coastal population, coastal pollution,   over-exploitation of resources, habitat loss and general degradation of   water.   In his view, marine biologists should shoulder their responsibilities   -- do research, teach people, act as independent advisors to   governments and promote the concepts of conservation and protection.   \"The future is in our hands, not in our children\\'s,\" said the chairman,   who is a professor of marine ecology from the Swire Institute of Marine   Science under the University of Hong Kong.

The company also announced it is close to an agreement to sell a   smaller business and an announcement of a sale agreement is expected   within the next two weeks.   Jordan said the electronic systems unit is \"a strong business, with   tremendous technology, excellent margins, outstanding employees, and   expansive prospects.\"   He added that changes in the defense industry, which has consolidated   into larger, highly efficient players, \"presented us with a clear   strategic choice: Take advantage of the high premiums for   defense-related assets and divest the business, or grow in scale to   retain our industry leadership position for the future.   \"Given this choice and our strategic decision to drive investment and   growth in our broadcasting business, the logical decision was the sale   of our defense electronics business,\" he said.

The offices would be opened in Washington and the North's capital of   Pyongyang under an agreement signed last Oct. 21 in which North Korea   promised to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for technical and   economic aid.   While in Pyongyang, the U.S. delegation is to look at possible sites   for the American office.   During talks in Washington last December, U.S. and North Korean   negotiators resolved many technical details, such as what   communications facilities the offices will have and what should be done   if a citizen of one country is arrested or injured in the other.   The brief dispatch Tuesday by the Korean Central News Agency gave no   further details on the U.S. negotiators' visit.   One prominent issue that remains unresolved is how U.S. diplomatic   staff would travel to North Korea.   U.S. officials want to cross the demilitarized zone between North and   South Korea. Pyongyang, which has been striving to exclude South Korea   from all its dealings with Washington, opposes that idea.   The exchange of liaison offices would be the first step toward   diplomatic ties between the bitter battlefield enemies. The United   States fought in the 1950-53 Korean War on South Korea's side.   U.S. officials have said the representation in each office will be at   the lowest level allowed by the international agreement governing   establishment of diplomatic relations.   Under the nuclear deal, the United States, Japan and South Korea are   creating an international consortium that will help finance two new   reactors, worth dlrs 4 billion, to be given to the North.   The North will also be provided with replacement oil until the reactors   are built by 2003.

Some 60.6 percent of the population believes similar violence will   \"probably\" erupt sometime in the next five years, according to a recent   poll by the University of Loyola-Marymount here.   On April 29, 1992, an all-white jury\\'s acquittal of the white policemen   who were videotaped beating African-American driver Rodney King   inflamed racial passions, igniting three days of burning and looting.   The violence left at least 50 people dead, 2,300 injured and more than   1,100 buildings damaged or destroyed. Los Angeles\\' different ethnic   groups all came away with different explanations of the riots.   Many Koreans blamed African-Americans. African-Americans saw the   violence as a consequence of white America\\'s racism. Latinos refer to   it as \"los quemazones\" -- the large flames -- while Koreans call it   sa-ee-gu: April 29.   The made-for-television movie \"Riot,\" to be shown exactly five years   after the violence that followed the unpopular court verdict, showcases   the views of this city\\'s different racial communities.   The film, to be shown on Tuesday, presents four directors\\' renditions   of the very different Asian, African-American, Latino and White   perspectives of the violence, which reduced parts of Los Angeles to   burning rubble.   The University of Loyola-Marymount reported that 36.4 percent of those   polled believe the 1992 riots made them more sensitive to the problems   faced by other races.   Only slightly fewer -- 28.7 percent -- say they felt more resentment   towards other communities. Nearly half of those polled, 49.3 percent,   said race relations had improved since the violence.   But 58.7 percent believe race relations are still poor and 47.8 percent   think things are getting worse.   Businesses in South Central, the neighborhood at the center of the   riots, have still not been rebuilt, dotting the economically deprived   area with vacant lots. All the city requires is that the owners put a   fence around them.   Some 200 properties have remained empty since the riots, according to a   study by The Los Angeles Times. And only one-third of all buildings   damaged or destroyed have been repaired or rebuilt.   \"You see, it looks terrible,\" South Central resident Lucille Hooper   told the newspaper. \"They haven\\'t built anything. It looks dead, a   ghost town.\"   Neighborhood reconstruction had been entrusted to the private sector   and an organization dubbed \"Rebuild L.A.\" (RLA) -- which had given   itself five years to achieve its goal.   RLA\\'s recently released final report estimates private sector   investment to repair the damage at 389 million dollars. The US   government has spent some 900 million.   But that falls far short of RLA consultant McKinsey and Co\\'s estimate   that it would cost six billion dollars to revitalize Los Angeles\\' poor   and damaged neighborhoods.   \"Much needs to be done,\" RLA reported. \"For example, many Korean   merchants never reopened their stores, and joblessness among blacks and   Latino teen-age males remains unacceptably high.\"   The riots left South Central with fewer liquor stores than before:   there had been 700.

Marcos reportedly borrowed 800 million dollars from Refal 196 during   his exile in Hawaii after his overthrow by popular revolt in 1986, and   signed promisory notes, which Refal is using to claim the money.   \"The promisory note is suspicious,\" said presidential legal counsel   Antonio Carpio, pointing out that the London company had lent the 800   million dollars without asking for collateral.   The Marcos money in Swiss banks is estimated at 500 million dollars.

       " 'training-2457': {'body': \"   Orleans Saints intercept a pass, they don't.   That proved to be the difference in the Saints' 24-16 loss to the   Cowboys on Monday night in the Louisiana Superdome.   The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Cowboys returned two   interceptions for touchdowns, eliminating New Orleans from the playoff   race and insuring only the second losing season in Jim Mora's nine   years as Saints' coach.   ``I just think we made too many mistakes to beat this team. They are a   good football team and you can't give them things. You can't help them.   We just helped them too much,'' Mora said.   ``I just turned the ball over too many times over to them. There are a   few balls I threw I wish I could have back,'' Saints quarterback Jim   Everett said.   The first interception Everett threw set the tempo for the game.   Effectively mixing the run and pass, the Saints were driving on the   opening possession of the game when Everett threw the ball into the   right flat which was intercepted by Cowboys defensive end Tony Tolbert   and returned 54 yards for a touchdown.   ``On the first interception, they had a defensive lineman covering a   back. It was something new that I wasn't prepared for and he (Tolbert)   made a good play,'' Everett said.   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman returned the favor late in the first   half. Saints defensive lineman Wayne Martin tipped a pass, with   linebacker Darion Conner coming up with the first interception of his   career, advancing the ball down to the Dallas 15-yard line.   The Saints (6-9) were unable to punch the ball into the end zone,   settling for a 21-yard Morten Andersen field goal to trail 7-3.   ``When we had the opportunity to make big plays, we had to capitalize   on those big plays,'' Conner said. ``When (the Cowboys) got a chance to   make big plays, they capitalized. It's all a matter of who capitalizes   when they get the opportunity.''   The Saints appeared to take the lead when cornerback Jimmy Spencer   intercepted Aikman at the Cowboy 36 and raced into the end zone. The   officals, however, ruled Spencer stepped out of bounds at the 26-yard   line. Spencer disputed the ball, with stadium replays appearing to back   the cornerback's claim.   ``When I ran it in, I was very excited. I was like, `hey, we're going   to beat these guys tonight,' and I started doing my little cowboy   imitation shooting them down. The next thing I know I'm walking down   the sideline, I'm looking like what's going on and was told the   officals said I was out of bounds. It's like everthing just dropped   (emotionally),'' Spencer said.   A disputed non-call came on the next play when Cowboys defensive back   Clayton Holmes appeared to rake Quinn Early's hands before the ball   reached him in the end zone on a pass from Everett.   ``Cowboys, I mean, America's Team. You got the refs, they were probably   out there with their Dallas Cowboy underwear on and they were pulling   for the Cowboys, too,'' said Spencer, who himself had been called for   pass interference earlier in the game.   Once again, the Saints had to settle for an Andersen field goal,   pulling New Orleans within 7-6 with 50 seconds left before halftime.   ``It's easy to cry about the calls, but the bottom line is you gotta   overcome anything out there. That's part of the football game. The game   doesn't say that if you get a bad call, that you wipe out a win or a   loss. You take it, you live with it, and that's that,'' Mills said.   A Chris Boniol field goal on the final play of the half extended the   Cowboys' lead to 10-6.   Dallas (12-3) went on a 16-play, 8:33 drive to open the second half,   with Emmitt Smith capping the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run and a   17-6 Cowboy lead.   Continuing a game-long pattern, the Saints drove the ball on the Dallas   defense, ranked No. 2 overall in the NFL, only to see the drive stall.   Andersen's 29-yard field goal pulled New Orleans within 17-9.   ``We moved up and down the field, but in the first half, especially, we   didn't get it done. I think that's the key between us being a good   football team and very good football team, is finding a way to   (consistently put the ball in the end zone),'' Saints' All-Pro tackle   William Roaf said.   Everett's second interception of the game, this one tipped by Saints'   running back Derek Brown into the arms of Darrin Smith, was returned 13   yards for a touchdown and a 24-9 lead.   A 4-yard touchdown run by Brown with 5:37 left in the game pulled New   Orleans within 24-16, but any chance the Saints had to rally ended when   Everett threw his third interception of the game, this one again to   Smith with 2:52 left in the contest.   The two interceptions for touchdowns made up for a sub-par offensive   performance by the Dallas offense.   Smith rushed for 74 yards before leaving the game with a hamstring   injury with 1:11 left in the third quarter.   Aikman threw for 175 yards, but was intercepted twice.   If the Cowboys are to become the first team to win three straight Super   Bowls, the team will have to perform better than it has the last two   weeks, according to Aikman.   ``This team has got to play better if we expect to do the things we   hope to do,'' said Aikman.   The Cowboys' lack of big plays on offense may have been due to Dallas   just taking what the Saints' defense was giving it, Mills said.   ``I think they were taking the underneath stuff and taking what they   could get just to keep good down and distance situations so we couldn't   put a lot of pressure on Troy,'' said Mills.

A recent survey has shown that investment by multinationals in China is   becoming more systematic, even as it grows in scale. To invest   systematically in China, multinationals have set up bases for product   development, after-sales service, and personnel training, while   investment scope has expanded from manufacturing to banking, insurance,   consultation, transportation and other interrelated industries.   Ji Chongwei, a research fellow with the Research and Development Center   of the State Council, says that many multinationals believe that China   is an ideal place to invest, and more than 200 of the best known,   including ten of Germany's largest industrial giants, and 17 of Japan's   top 20, are in China.   Wang Zhile, an economist who has studied more than 50 multinationals   now operating in China, says that most have joint-stock investment   companies in China, which is regarded as an important step toward   systematic investment. He has found that joint-stock companies with   agencies, marketing, personnel training, financial aid and information   services can co-ordinate scattered investment and build a unified   system.   Omron Corporation of Japan was the first to open an investment   joint-stock company in China, followed by Japan's Hitachi, Matsushita,   Sanyo, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Alps and Isuzu, and Germany's Siemens,   Hoechst, Bayer and Henkel.   Experts said that many transnational corporations have worked out   realistic development strategies, emphasizing the localization of parts   and spares, technology development and qualified personnel training.   Siemens has so far set up more than 30 joint ventures in China and the   number will soar to 50 at the end of this century. By then, Siemens   will have an investment of one billion dollars, have 30,000 employees   here, and annual sales of as much as 10 billion US dollars, while   German chemical giant BASF plans to establish a petrochemical base in   China.   Most investment by multinationals is now in the Pearl River and Yangtze   River deltas, and along the Bohai rim. But China's westward push in its   development strategy has caused some multinationals, like Siemens, to   begin paying closer attention to the country's interior.\",\n",

We need time,\" said   Burns, referring to US efforts to end the fighting between the   Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massud Barzani and the Patriotic   Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of Jalal Talabani.   Burns warned that \"it would be a great mistake by Saddam Hussein\" if   press reports of Iraqi troop movements toward the north are correct.   Meanwhile, a KDP delegation led by Barzani\\'s nephew, Narjevan, met at   the State Department on Thursday in the presence of British and Turkish   diplomats.   The US delegation, led by Robert Deutsch, head of the State   Department\\'s Iraq and Iran bureau, emphasized the \"need to move quickly   toward a cease-fire\" and to ensure the safety of humanitarian groups   working in the troubled region, Burns said.

Both have agreed to meet with Pelletreau, but the date   and the location has not been set, Burns said.   Fighting between the Kurdish factions has flared since the KDP seized   the main Kurdish city of Arbil on August 31 in an offensive backed by   Iraqi troops and tanks.   The United States fired cruise missiles at Iraqi air defenses to punish   Baghdad for its foray into the Kurdish-populated north and expanded a   no-flight zone in southern Iraq.

The Virginia Slims of Los Angeles tournament, at least as far   as top seeds and big draws go, went into the dumpster.   The good news is that the semifinalists today have relatively fresh new   faces and games.   The bad news is that, among them, this late in the year, the   semifinalists have won only three tournaments. For the first time ever,   the Slims will be won by someone not ranked in the world top 10.   In fact, there's nobody left in Manhattan Beach in the world top 17.   No. 1 seed Conchita Martinez of Spain, the Wimbledon champion, was   beaten in straight sets by Amy Frazier of Michigan 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).   No. 5 seed Zina Garrison-Jackson of Texas was beaten by Frazier's   friend since girlhood, Ann Grossman of Ohio, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.   No. 4 seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic was ousted by Sabine   Appelmans of Belgium 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.   Martina Navratilova, the second seed who was eliminated by Grossman in   singles Thursday, couldn't stick around for doubles either. She and   partner Manon Bollegraf were beaten by Laura Golarsa-Mercedes Paz 6-7   (7-3), 6-4, 6-1, after which the losers took their impromptu dip in the   Manhattan Country Club pool.   (The plunge was certainly to cool off on a hot day. Perhaps it was also   to put an exclamation point on the last match the soon-to-retire   Navratilova would ever play in a tournament she has won eight times.)   Here's a brief poke through the tournament's rubble:   -- World Nos. 1, 2, 11 and 13, Steffi Graf, Arantxa Sanchex Vicario,   Gigi Fernandez and Amanda Coetzer, didn't enter.   -- Nos. 5, 7, 9, 10 and 15, Kimiko Date, Lindsay Davenport, Natalia   Zvereva, Gabriela Sabatini and Lori McNeil, withdrew because of injury.   -- No. 6 Mary Pierce withdrew because of a ``schedule change.''   -- Nos. 3, 4, 12 and 14, Martinez, Navratilova, Garrison-Jackson and   Anke Huber, were knocked out early.   The big surprise Friday was Frazier's win over Martinez, who had looked   invincible the night before in beating Elena Likhovtseva 6-0, 6-0.   Fearing Martinez's topspin forehand, Frazier played mostly to her   backhand.   ``I think she made a few more errors today than she usually does and I   got a few free points,'' said Frazier. ``Usually she doesn't miss.   ``I hit my ground strokes well and I was patient. Sometimes when I play   her I try to hit too good a shot too early, because she runs so well   and hits everything so deep.''   Grossman had her second straight big match at the Slims. After her   three-set upset of Navratilova, she had difficulty sleeping. Then she   took a long nap after a massage and had difficulty waking up from that.   But she was ready for Garrison-Jackson when their evening match rolled   around. Garrison-Jackson got angry numerous times at line calls and   umpire decisions, while Grossman, who has never won a tournament and is   ranked 46th in the world kept her head -- and her hard-hit baseline   shots.   ``I felt it was an unbelievable match,'' said Grossman, ``especially   for the crowd. It was a great level of tennis.''\",\n",

He said it would take at least one month to drive the separatists out.   \"In the current situation, I see only force as a way of getting out of   the situation which has come about in Grozny,\" he told Interfax.   Russian artillery bombarded rebel positions in the devastated Chechen   capital during the night and early Tuesday, Pulikovsky told ITAR-TASS.   \"(Russian) artillery is accurately shelling designated targets (in   Grozny) but aircraft are not being used,\" Pulikovsky said.   He said his troops had already managed to break through separatist   blockades around a number of Russian federal positions in the city.   He told civilians late Monday to get out of Grozny within 48 hours,   warning he would then use all means at his disposal to drive out the   fighters, who seized much of the city in a surprise offensive on August   6, trapping thousands of Russian troops in street fighting.   Interfax meanwhile quoted Chechen rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov   urging Russian Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed to exert all   his influence \"to stop the approaching madness,\" saying Pulikovsky\\'s   threat amounted to a \"blackmail of the civilian population.\"   Maskhadov said the separatist rebels, who are fighting for independence   from Russia, were taking the ultimatum \"very calmly.\"   \"Implementation of commander Pulikovsky\\'s threats will not bring glory   to the Russian forces, but will only exacerbate the situation, forcing   it into a blind alley,\" Maskhadov said.

Maskhadov held talks late Monday with an aide to Lebed, Sergei   Kharlamov, in the village of Novy Atagi, 25 kilometres (15 miles) south   of Grozny, Russian RTR television reported.

       " 'training-2637': {'body': \"   foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev, came to the Security Council on   Monday to win sympathy for Saddam Hussein but was roundly rebuffed by   the United States.   Kozyrev, fresh from a visit to Iraq and Kuwait, criticized the Iraqi   troop buildup near the Kuwaiti border for creating ``a dangerous   situation.'' But he also suggested that Iraq had no intention of   invading Kuwait, citing reports in the Iraqi press that the troops were   merely conducting maneuvers.   Speaking to the Security Council for the first time, Kozyrev said that   the joint communique that he won from Baghdad last week proved that   Iraq understood the need to recognize the sovereignty and borders of   Kuwait. The Russian official argued that the international community   must be prepared to consider lifting the oil embargo against Iraq if it   continues to cooperate with U.N. weapons monitors.   The presentation was sharply criticized by the chief U.S. delegate,   Madeleine K. Albright, though she did not address Kozyrev directly, and   the Russian's words drew no support from other Security Council   members.   What was exceptional about the meeting on Monday was that it pitted Ms.   Albright against Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and to a   lesser extent against Kozyrev, in a public Security Council forum.   Kozyrev's remarks and his presence in the Security Council chamber   seemed to give weight to a subsequent statement by Aziz, who accused   the United States and Britain of leading an unjust campaign to deny   Iraq economic relief despite what he called his country's cooperation   with the United Nations.   The meeting also drew attention to the vastly different approaches used   by Washington and Moscow in dealing with Saddam.   The United States insists on maximum Iraqi compliance with U.N. demands   without spelling out exactly what Saddam must do if he wants a partial   lifting of the sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's invasion of   Kuwait in 1990 and at the end of the Persian Gulf war the next year.   According to this line of reasoning, if he complies with all of the   Security Council resolutions, he will probably not survive politically.   Russia, by contrast, follows a step-by-step approach that takes Saddam   at his word and would reward him in stages if he continues to show a   willingess to cooperate with the Security Council.   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   That split was reflected in the statements during Monday's meeting.   ``The Security Council must be ready to take yes for an answer if Iraq   really complies with all of the demands in all of the resolutions,''   Kozyrev said.   He laid out a timetable in which Iraq would first formally recognize   Kuwait. That would be followed by long-term monitoring of its weapons   programs a month from now and a possible Security Council decision to   lift the oil embargo against Iraq six months after that.   To rebut Kozyrev's assertion that the Iraqi military deployment was not   serious, Ms. Albright edited her prepared statement to insert a passage   declaring that the threat ``was real.'' She added that Iraq must not be   led to believe that it can choose ``in an a la carte fashion'' which of   its international obligations it will fulfill. ``It is not the   council's job to respond to a threat or to reward it with half   measures,'' she said.   She told Aziz bluntly: ``Words are cheap. Actions are the coin of the   realm.''   That assessment was echoed by the British representative, Sir David   Hannay, who told Aziz that recognition of Kuwait ``is not some carrot   to be dangled and then snatched away, as the Iraqi government is   currently doing.''   The most dramatic moment came when Sir David ended his remarks by   charging that ``the continued presence of Saddam Hussein as president   of Iraq'' made it difficult for the council to trust that Iraq will not   break its promises.   Aziz, who had been sitting back in his chair calmly smoking a cigarette   throughout much of the debate, became visibly distraught and began   scribbling notes on a white legal pad. His face flushed with anger, he   accused Sir David of interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign   nation.   While the remarks by Kozyrev and Aziz did not address a resolution that   was on the table, they gave an indication of how the debate on Iraqi   compliance with U.N. demands might unfold in the coming months. Over   the weekend, Russia joined other Security Council members in a   resolution condemning the deployment of Iraqi troops.   After the Security Council meeting, Aziz did not suggest that his   country was on the verge of a formal recognition of Kuwait's   sovereignty and borders that would meet the criteria set by the United   Nations. Asked by a reporter whether his country recognized Kuwait,   Aziz replied: ``It is under consideration.''   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   Pentagon officials said on Monday that they were encouraged that the   last two brigades of republican guard soldiers in southern Iraq were   moving north toward their home garrisons. But military intelligence   analysts said that they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine the Iraqi   troops' final destination.   Defense Secretary William J. Perry said last week that at least 30,000   American ground forces would go to Kuwait even if Iraq withdrew the two   republican guard divisions that menaced the Kuwaiti border. But   Pentagon officials on Monday were reviewing whether to send 18,000   Marines from Camp Pendleton and other bases in southern California,   given the easing tensions.   If the Marines do not deploy, the United States will eventually send   only 10,000 to 12,000 Marines and Army soldiers to Kuwait. There are   7,250 ground forces there now.   Perry had also said that 400 to 500 American combat aircraft would fly   to the gulf. Pentagon officials said on Monday that about 220 aircraft   had arrived so far, the deployments were slowing, and that the total   number might be less than originally planned.   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   In Baghdad, Iraq's Parliament praised Saddam on Monday for his efforts   to win the lifting of economic sanctions but gave no sign that it had   voted in its closed session on recognizing Kuwait. Senior   administration officials believe that Iraq is holding out the prospect   of recognition in exchange for a timetable for lifting at least part of   the economic sanctions, which have devastated its economy over the last   four years.   The position taken by the United States, Britain, and France is that   for the Security Council to accept Iraq's recognition of Kuwait, its   Parliament must pass a decree to that effect; Saddm himself must sign   it; it must be published in the Iraqi Parliament's official gazette and   sent to the United Nations as a formal document.   Clinton administration officials in Washington and at the United   Nations said that the tone of Kozyrev's public remarks contrasted with   the warm atmosphere at a breakfast meeting on Monday with Secretary of   State Warren M. Christopher in Ms. Albright's residence.   After their meeting, Christopher said that the American partnership   with Russia was ``durable and working well.'' Another senior State   Department official said: ``The cooperative Kozyrev was in the private   meeting today.''   Those officials noted that Russia voted for the Security Council   resolution last Saturday night, demanding that Iraq withdraw its elite   troops from the Kuwaiti border, though it had tried to delay the vote   until after Kozyrev made his presentation on Monday.   But that action is separate from the issue of whether to eventually   lift economic sanctions. Iraq owes Russia billions of dollars from the   days when the Soviet Union was Baghdad's main arms supplier and has   signed $17 billion in potential new deals; so Moscow has an enormous   stake in helping the Iraqi regime to reopen trade.\",\n",

       " 'training-2616': {'body': '   Australia faces constitutional turmoil a week before the queen\\'s arrival   after the prime minister refused an opposition call to sack her   representative here over a deepening child abuse scandal.   Prime Minister John Howard said he had found no grounds on which to   advise the queen to terminate Governor-General Peter Hollingworth\\'s   appointment despite claims he had covered up complaints of child sex   abuse.   \"People will say, and he has admitted, that he has probably been guilty   of some errors of judgment in relation to certain matters, but that is   for none of us, to use the colloquialism, of itself a hanging offence,\"   Howard told reporters.   Howard announced his backing for the Governor-General after opposition   Labor leader Simon Crean told him Labor had withdrawn its support for   Hollingworth and sought his dismissal.   But the prime minister said sacking Hollingworth would be unprecedented   and the equivalent of a constitutional earthquake.   However, constitutional experts say an Australian governor-general   requires bipartisan political support to continue in office and   withdrawal of that support creates a constitutional minefield.   Professor George Williams, one of Australia\\'s leading experts in   constitutional law, said the government was under pressure to consider   the opposition call.   \"We cannot afford to have a governor-general who does not have the   support of both parties and, at the least, I hope we have some sort of   process that might enable the opposition to regain their support of the   governor general,\" he said.   Professor Elaine Thompson said the withdrawal of Labor support meant   Hollingworth had lost legitimacy in the view of one side of politics.   \"The entire justification for the constitutional monarchy rests on the   idea that it is a symbolic position above politics and won\\'t be   subjected to this sort of partisanship,\" she told AFP.   Hollingworth has admitted he appointed as head of an Anglican sexual   abuse committee a priest he had personally cleared of child sex abuse   and who was forced to step down only after another allegation against   him.   The Governor-General also sparked a storm of protest by blaming a   14-year-old girl who was sexually abused by a priest who later became a   bishop -- and taking no action against the bishop.   A 10-page statement he issued on Wednesday expressing regret but   avoiding an apology hardened attitudes against him.   But as he left for New Zealand Thursday to meet the queen on the first   leg of a tour that will bring her to Australia, Hollingworth said he   wanted to make an unreserved apology to the woman sexually abused as a   14-year-old.   He said he had misunderstood a question during an interview screened by   ABC television on Monday and wrongly gave the impression he condoned   child sex abuse.   Queensland state Labor Premier Peter Beattie who will host a   Commonwealth leaders summit to be opened by the queen at Coolum on   March 2 also called on Howard to dismiss or suspend Hollingworth before   the queen arrives pending an open inquiry.   Child protection activists and women\\'s groups expressed outrage at   Howard\\'s support for Hollingworth.   \"I\\'m very angry that he has decided to make this decision,\" said Hetty   Johnston, director of the People\\'s Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse.   \"At the end of the day, he\\'s the only man who can do the right thing by   Australian children.\"',\n",

Wicketkeeper Adam Parore scored an unbeaten maiden Test century and   fast bowler Danny Morrison took four for 33, including the wicket of   the world\\'s best batsman, Brian Lara, for two.   The West Indies finished the day on 102 for five, needing another 42   runs to avoid the follow-on after New Zealand had declared at 341 for   eight.   However, with two days lost to rain the match is unlikely to produce a   result although new coach John Reid was optimistic.   \"We talked in the dressing room quite openly before we went out to bowl   today that only one team could win the Test match and that was us -- so   we may as well give it 100 percent,\" said Reid who replaced Geoff   Howarth in the furore over the cannabis-smoking in South Africa.   \"If we can bowl them out for 140 or less they\\'re going to have to bat   again -- we could win this Test match,\" he added.   Dion Nash, batsman Stephen Fleming and allrounder Matthew Hart, who   were suspended for the one-day internationals for smoking cannabis, all   played today.   Lara was at the crease for only 18 minutes when Morrison got his slower   ball to duck back into the lefthander and the world record Test scorer   got an inside edge on to his leg stump.   \"It was good to get that little fella,\" Morrison said.   \"It\\'s nice to outfox a lefthander like that. You bounce them, then you   come wide and go across them and then bowl that slow pie thing which   hugs back into his off stump.\"   Morrison was also rapt to have outsmarted two of the West Indies better   batsmen -- Williams and Jimmy Adams -- with his bouncer.   \"They\\'re impulsive and they\\'re bought up on a diet of quick bowling in   the Caribbean so they do play that shot a lot and they back themselves   to score from it.   Parore had to overcome a fear of the West Indies pace attack which had   ruined his one-day series.   \"Coming out of the one-day series I was a little bit bewildered about   how I was going to score a run against these guys,\" he said. \"I was   somewhat intimidated by them as well.\"   He spent most of his five-hour stay at the crease avoiding short   pitched deliveries -- which as a wicketkeeper, who has to look after   his hands, he felt very vulnerable to.   \"The bounce that Walsh and Ambrose get is really difficult to deal   with,\" he explained.   \"If you stand up and play you\\'ll just get bashed around the hands and   arms from the sheer number of short balls you get.\"   Parore was well supported by Hart who hit his highest Test score of 45   as the pair put on 118 for the seventh wicket.',\n",

       " 'training-2631': {'body': '   France\\'s newspapers joined with trade unions Tuesday to try to repel a   Scandinavian invasion, as a Swedish press group moved to add titles in   Paris and Marseille to its international media empire.   For the second day running, Communist trade unionists scuffled with   teams attempting to distribute the free daily Metro to Parisian   commuters, while the Marseille edition left its printing plant under   police escort.   And while their print workers and van drivers took the battle against   the Scandivanian imports to the streets, France\\'s outraged journalists   took up the defence of their paid-for papers.   \"Beware of forgeries!\" warned the left-wing daily Liberation, as the   turmoil in its own industry elbowed France\\'s presidential election   campaign off the front page of many papers (although not Metro\\'s).   \"The first day of free newspapers was a dark day for the press,\"   complained the Catholic paper La Croix.   \"It\\'s quick to pick up, quick to read, quick to throw out. A certain   idea of news information is being thrown in the bin,\" it said.   The Swedish press group Metro International on Monday targeted Paris   and Marseille for new city editions of Metro, a 24-page colour tabloid   filled with short news stories and photos from international news   agencies.   Metro already appears in distinct editions in 20 cities in 14 countries   around the world outside France and claims to have nine million   readers. It is paid for entirely by advertising revenue.   Another Scandinavian firm, Norway\\'s Schibsted, intends to launch a   version of its similar daily, 20 Minutes, in Paris shortly.   Metro\\'s launch provoked the fury of members of the main trade union   representing French publishing workers, the Communist CGT, who   destroyed 50,000 copies of Metro in a Marseille printing plant and   scuffled with teams handing it out in Paris.   On Tuesday, the Marseille edition hit the streets under police   protection, but trouble continued in the capital.   \"Some 400 of our members intervened at all the distribution points   outside metro stations. The copies were scattered over the streets.   Compared to Monday, 10 times fewer copies were handed out,\" claimed a   CGT official.   Television pictures showed protesters struggling with Metro staff and   tossing the papers into the road.   The union\\'s claim appeared overly optimistic, however: AFP reporters   arriving for work from across Paris found Metro being distributed   unimpeded at major stations.   At Marcadet-Poissoniers station in the north of the city curious   commuters grabbed Metro from a neat stack outside the entrance. In one   carriage heading towards the city centre half a dozen travellers were   reading it.   Some 200,000 copies of the Paris edition were printed beyond the reach   of CGT activists in Luxembourg overnight, Metro said. The firm hopes to   shift production to Paris and step it up to 300,000 copies if the   protest can be resolved.   The CGT threatened to bring the entire newspaper industry, including   traditional titles, to a halt on Monday if Culture Minister Catherine   Tasca does not convene a meeting to hear their complaints.   \"We don\\'t want to penalise the paid-for press, just to demonstrate what   life wouldc5#like with only the free papers and none of the paid-fors,\"   Jean-Francois Ropert of the CGT\\'s publishing section told AFP.   Tasca had earlier called on unions and press groups to sit down and   discuss their differences.   The unions and the mainstream press fear th.   \"The difference between Liberation (or another big national paid-for   paper) and a freesheet is 250 journalists to 10,\" Liberation said. \"You   are buying expertise, intelligence, context, analysis and choice.   \"The freesheets look like newspapers, they have the odour and   appearance of newsprint, but the resemblance stops there,\" the paper   declared.',\n",

Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and visiting   Chairman of Russian State Duma Gennady Seleznyov voiced their concern   during their talks Monday, the Iranian official news agency IRNA   reported.   Seleznyov, who arrived here Sunday night for an official visit, said   the ongoing Afghan crisis will endanger the security of the region and   increase drug trafficking.   Afghanistan has been bogged down in civil war since 1996 when the   Taliban militia ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani.   Fightings between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance led by Rabbani   have escalated with the step-up of the Taliban\\'s moves to expand its   controlled areas.   Nouri said the current situation in Afghanistan is a tragic issue for   all the humanity and it is regretful that the Taliban is plundering,   murdering, committing genocide and destroying Afghanistan.   The magnitude of the catastrophe is the fact that all indecent acts are   being carried out under the banner of Islam, he said, criticizing the   Taliban for creating unrest in the region and expanding smuggle of   narcotics.   Nouri noted that the only way to save Afghanistan is to form a   broad-based government made up of all groups, without foreign   intervention.   The speaker also said cooperation between Iran and Russia would be   important for this purpose.   Referring to the Caspian Sea, Seleznyov said the littoral states,   namely Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan, should   employ more rational methods for exploitation of the sea\\'s resources.   Nouri stressed that the Caspian region should remain as a non-military   zone and Iran believes all the countries concerned can reach consensus   on the determination of the Caspian legal regime.   Terming the Tehran-Moscow relations as \"satisfactory,\" Nouri said that   the ties were growing and the two countries should utilize their   potential to deepen and expand mutual political and economic   cooperation.   Nouri also called for joint Tehran-Moscow efforts to thwart \"enemies\\'   expansionist goals\" in the region, apparently referring to the United   States and Israel.   Nouri condemned Israel\\'s expansionist moves to Judaize Jerusalem and   change its demographic structure. He urged the international community   to address the issue.   Israel approved a plan on June 21 to extend Jerusalem municipal   authority to eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which violated   the spirit of its signed agreements with the Palestinians.   Terming Israel as a symbol of state terrorism, he said that Iran is   among the first victims of terrorism and believes that all countries   should uproot any form of terrorism through coordination.',\n",

Rainsy was kicked out of his post as finance minister after he revealed   and tried to clean up corruption within the ranks; he then was booted   out of parliament altogether in June due to a squabble within his   party, FUNCINPEC, which withdrew his party membership and the   legislative seat that went with it.   \"Cambodia doesn\\'t belong to a handful of corrupt and totalitarian   people,\" he told some 300 supporters in Paris. \"Give Cambodia back to   the Cambodians.\"   The crowd included supporters of the country\\'s murderous Khmer Rouge   and sought to join all who oppose the Cambodian government -- elected   under United Nations scrutiny in 1993 -- in what Rainsy called a \"New   Alliance.\"   He denied that he was forming a new political party, but the New   Alliance has a 10-point platform and the meeting outlining its ideas   was conducted like a party congress. Its main points promote peace with   Khmer Rouge guerrillas, an end to corruption and freedom of expression.   \"If the government follows this program, I would consider that I am no   more in opposition,\" he said. \"If it doesn\\'t follow it, I would be in   opposition.\"   The current government \"lets anarchy rule the country,\" the former   minister, who enjoys broad popular support back home, said in a speech   mixing French and Khmer and sprinkled with jokes blasting corruption   among former colleagues.

The transfer of authority was marked by the admission of 460 Mobile   Brigade personnel and the withdrawal of 1,500 combat troops from East   Timor in two separate ceremonies in Dili, capital of East Timor.   Provincial Police chief Col. Timbul Silaen, who received the Mobile   Brigade officers, said their main mission was to maintain security,   enforce the law and protect the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor   (UNAMET), who are in the territory to help organize the ballot.   \"With the new authority, the police are expected to take charge of   stopping crimes, the illegal possession of guns, violence and   intimidation against local people.

He said 3,900 security personnel from the provincial police force had   been deployed to eight regencies to maintain security ahead of the   Indonesian general election on Monday until the August 8 ballot. The   August 8 ballot will determine whether the East Timorese accept an   autonomy package or establish an independent nation.   The Mobile Brigade personnel, who arrived in Dili on Saturday, will be   deployed to three other regencies. Approximately 4,000 more Mobile   Brigade personnel are scheduled to arrive in the near future to help   protect the U.N. mission.   Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5, the U.N.   will deploy civilian police advisers from several countries to assist   Indonesian police in maintaining law and order. A key function will be   the disarmament of rival factions that are either for or against   independence.   Since January, dozens of East Timorese have been killed in clashes   between the warring factions.   The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into   Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which still   considers Portugal as the administering power of the territory.

Rabin is scheduled to see Clinton at the White House next Monday along   with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. But talks are also planned   with the buoyant Republican leaders.   He announced after the US elections that Washignton\\'s support for   Israel was bipartisan. \"Republicans and Democrats strongly and equally   support Israel,\" said Rabin, who has in the past backed Republicans   against Democrats.   Ultra-conservative Republican senator Jesse Helms has threatened to   slash foreign aid when he takes over the Senate Foreign Relations   Committee in January.   He hit out at the aid programme of \"an estimated two trillion dollars   of the American taxpayers\\' money, much of it going down foreign rat   holes.\"   Helms oppposes greater US military aid in the event of an Israeli   withdrawal from the Golan Heights as part of a peace deal with Syria.   Rabin will also ask the United States to sign a memorandum to continue   the financing of the anti-missile missle Arrow, which is being   developed by Israel Aircraft Industries with Washington picking up   three-quarters of the bill.   The missile, originally part of the US \"Star Wars\" programme, is about   to enter the development stage after tests.   Israeli foreign ministry officials have voiced concern the Clinton   administration will now struggle to uphold international commitments.   \"Clinton has suffered a serious blow,\" said an internal foreign   ministry document published in the Hebrew press.   \"We can no longer totally rely on his promises of maintaining aid to   Israel at current levels or of offering American guarantees for   Arab-Israeli peace.\"   As a goodwill gesture, Rabin has again urged his ministers to purchase   American automobiles and not European models, the officials said.   Rabin starts the trip Wednesday in Los Angeles at a showbiz gala dinner   with Barbara Streisand before flying to Denver to address Jewish   organizations.',\n",

The three European makers, of which Aerospatiale and BAe are also major   partners in Airbus, are eager to \"establish technological and   industrial links with a country which has decided to develop an   aviation industry and whose potential market is huge,\" one of the   companies said.   The aim is both to boost the European aircraft industry\\'s low-level   commercial ties with China, where Boeing is in a much stronger   position, and in the long term to associate Chinese industry in the   production of the Airbus so as to cut costs and increase competitivity.   In April, Airbus announced the sale of 30 of its A-320 model to China   in a deal which angered Boeing. Until then, Airbus accounted for only   seven percent of western-built airliners bought by China, where Boeing   holds 70 percent of the market with 250 aircraft in service.   Also in April, Aerospatiale seized on Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng\\'s   visit to Toulouse, the French aircraft-building capital, to encourage   China to expand ties in this field.

Duhalde\\'s Peronist party lost by just three votes (99-102) in its bid   to change the controversial law, which criminalizes bad business   decisions and capital flight.   Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna returned from a visit to the   International Monetary Fund this week \"hopeful and pleased, because if   Argentine fulfills the 14 points agreed by provincial governors, we   will find a quick solution to our problems,\" Duhalde said.

       " 'training-0608': {'body': \"   Leading German conservatives -- including a Cabinet member and senior   police officials -- have opted out of a celebration of the 50th   anniversary of V-E Day and instead will hold a day of mourning in   Munich.   Underlying the alternative ceremony is an attempt to get Germans to   stop seeing themselves as the unique evil-doers of the century, Heimo   Schwilk, the Berlin intellectual who organized the event, said in an   interview Monday.   Schwilk said Nazi crimes under Hitler, however horrible, were   comparable to other mass murders of the century -- by Stalin, the   Cambodian Khmer Rouge -- and the Americans with the atomic bomb.   While May 8, 1945 symbolizes the liberation of the concentration camps,   it also marked the start of communist enslavement of eastern Europe and   forced exile of 12 million Germans from former German territory that   was incorporated into Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union after   the war.   A statement published Friday by Schwilk and 300 others, including   Carl-Dieter Spranger, the overseas development minister, set off an   outcry. There were demands that Chancellor Helmut Kohl step in to   clarify that Germany is grateful for having been liberated by the   Allies.   Kohl, who has invited American, British, French and Russian leaders to   the official May 8 ceremony in Berlin, was off on a three-week fast in   the Austrian Alps when the conservative statement was published.   His spokesman, Peter Hausmann, said the statement represented ``part of   the political spectrum that has every right to express its opinion   about May 8, a day that evokes many mixed feelings.''   The statement, published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, called   May 8 a day of mourning. Thousands of German soldiers perished in   Soviet camps after May 8. Eastern Europe was occupied by tyranny.   Germans east of the Oder River were driven from their homes, the   statement said.   Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany's Jewish community, said the   signatories were ``lovers of the bad old days who would just as soon   continue everything that happened between 1933 and 1945, maybe with the   exception of genocide.''   A curious informal coalition stands behind the May 7 celebration.   It includes police commissioner Manfred Kittlaus, in charge of   investigating communist crimes in East Germany, and Dieter Stein, an   editor put under federal police watch this year because his ``Juenge   Freiheit'' newspaper is a rallying point for rightist radicals.   The scheduled May 7 speakers include far leftist apostate Klaus Rainer   Roehl, widower of Red Army Faction leader Ulrike Meinhof; and Ernst   Nolte, who argues that Stalin was as responsible as Hitler for the   outbreak of World War II.   Rita Suessmuth, the president of the German parliament, said the   group's statement had confused cause and effect.   ``The suffering and injustice of the deportations (of Germans after   World War II) was all a result of the murderous suffering that Hitler   and his leadership from Germany imposed on the world,'' she said.   Schwilk admitted that his agenda went beyond May 8. He argued that   Germans wouldn't become a self-confident people until they stopped   seeing the Holocaust as a unique crime of humanity.   The alternative ceremony will be held at a Munich theater May 7.   Commenting on the provocative choice of Munich, hometown of Hitler's   movement, Schwilk said it was the only city where police could   guarantee the meeting wouldn't be disrupted by left-wing radicals.   Ten years ago, in a speech for the 40th anniversary of V-E Day,   President Richard von Weizsaecker declared May 8 ``the day of   liberation, the day that freed us all from the inhuman system of Nazi   dictatorship.''   Alfred Dregger, a leading Christian Democrat and organizer of the May 7   ceremony, said the call to mourn the day was an ``addenda, and not a   negation'' of Weizsaecker's speech.   ``We were freed from Nazism on May 8, 1945,'' Dregger said. ``But   unfortunately peace and human rights were not established across   Europe, and the politicians of the past 50 years were partly   responsible. And I see no reason why we should just accept that.''\",\n",

Kyodo quoted government officials as saying the protest had been made   in a letter sent by the fisheries agency to the US Commerce Department.   The letter argues that research whaling conducted by Japan is   legitimate under an agreement of the International Whaling Commission   (IWC), the officials said.   In Washington on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's   National Marine Fisheries Service hinted that President Bill Clinton   could impose sanctions against Japan following the department's   investigation.   The Japanese officials, however, said there was little possibility that   sanctions would be invoked against Japan, citing a similar case   involving Norway in which Washington had not taken punitive action,   Kyodo said.

Cagliari's victory was the first at home over Juventus in 15 years and   the first since a 1-0 victory at home over Genoa on Nov. 20. It was   0-4-2 since the Genoa victory.   Juventus suffered only its second loss the season (11-3-2) and remained   atop the standings with 36 points   AC Parma (9-5-2) had a chance to move within a point of Juve with a   victory over visiting Napoli in the late match.   Three-time defending champion AC Milan (7-7-3) continued its steady   climb, moving into a virtual tie for fourth place with 28 points with a   2-0 victory over Fiorentina.   AS Roma also has 28 points, but has a better goal-differential than the   Devils, after a 1-1 draw with Cremonese.   Third-place Lazio of Rome (9-4-4) edged last-place Brescia 1-0 to pull   within five points of Juve.   In other games Sunday, Sampdoria of Genoa and Bari drew 1-1, Foggia   beat Reggiana 1-0, Padova defeated Internazionale of Milan 1-0, and   Torino and Genoa drew 0-0.   At Cagliari, Muzzi converted a penalty in the 65th minute and set up   the other two goals as Juve's pattern of trouble with lesser teams   continued.   The hosts (5-7-5) took advantage of opportunities to counterattack from   the outset, with Muzzi earning a penalty in the sixth minute when he   was dragged down by defender Ciro Ferrara. Brazilian-born striker Luis   Oliveira connected from the spot. Muzzi also served Panamanian Julio   Cesar Dely Valdes for the double in the 53rd minute.   Juventus has beaten the league's powerhouses, but the blemishes on its   record are courtesy of weaker clubs. Its other loss was to eighth-place   Foggia, and its draws were with relegation-zone squads Brescia and   Genoa and 11th-place Inter.   At Milan, the Red and Black kept league-leading scorer Gabriel   Batistuta of Argentina in check all game and took advantage of   Fiorentina defender Daniele Carnasciali's expulsion in first-half   injury time.   Milan pressed the attack in the second half and French midfielder   Marcel Desailly chipped in a rebound from 3 meters in the 78th minute   for his first goal of the season. Winger Paolo Di Canio, acquired from   Juventus in September, doubled five minutes later on a solo run,   netting his first goal with Milan.   After a 3-2-3 start, Milan has not lost in its last nine matches.   At Rome, defender Marco Lanna's first goal of the season salvaged the   draw for the hosts (7-7-3).   Forward Enrico Chiesa put Cremonese (5-2-10) ahead in the 39th minute,   catching backup goalkeeper Fabrizio Lorieri off his line with a   20-meter blast. Lorieri, making just his second appearance of the   season, played for suspended starter Giovanni Cervone.   At Brescia, Croat striker Alen Boksic continued his impressive return   from an injury that sidelined him for six weeks, netting the winner in   the 27th minute off a feed from Roberto Cravero. Boksic scored three   goals last week and Sunday's tally took his season total to seven.   Brescia, which had gone four games without a loss, fell to 1-6-10.   At Genoa, winger Attilio Lombardo, playing in his 135th consecutive   first-division game, scored the equalizer in the 78th minute for   Sampdoria (6-7-4). Lombardo has not missed a league game since the   1990-91 season.   Striker Sandro Tovalieri gave Bari (7-2-8) the lead on a free kick from   the edge of the penalty area in the seventh minute. Tovalieri's 11   goals are second in the league, behind Batistuta's 15.   Samp's English international David Platt, who has scored two of his   five goals this season on penalty kicks, saw his weak effort from the   spot saved by keeper Alberto Fontana in the 28th.   At Foggia, stopper Giovanni Bucaro's first career goal, in the 51st   minute, gave the hosts (6-6-5) the victory. Reggiana (3-3-11) failed to   gain a single standings point from its nine road games in the season's   first half, just the 10th time in league history that has happened.   At Padova, stopper Massimiliano Rosa tallied from 1 meter off a   86th-minute corner kick and the league's worst defense (36 goals   allowed) played well. Padova improved to 5-2-10, while Inter (5-6-6)   dropped two spots to 11th place.   At Turin, the hosts (5-5-6) recorded their fifth consecutive home   shutout in a lackluster match.

In this sense, the   establishment of re-employment service centers is an effective measure.   All enterprises which lay off workers must set up re-employment service   centers or similar organizations, which will be responsible for   providing basic living expenses, paying social insurance fees for them,   organizing vocational training and helping them obtain new jobs.   In principle, one third of social insurance funds should come from   fiscal budgets of central and local governments, one third from   enterprises and the remainder from other sectors of the society.   However, the proportions may vary in different localities. Poor areas   will get financial assistance from the central government, the premier   said.   Zhu pointed out that retired workers from state enterprises should be   guaranteed comfort in their remaining years, because they have made   great contributions to the country. Pensions must be paid on time, and   any delayed part must be paid retroactively.   In this regard, legislation will be stepped up to ensure the collection   of pension funds, which can only be used to buy treasury bonds. Anyone   embezzling, misusing or wasting such funds will be severely punished.   In addition, workers in state-owned enterprises may not retire before   the legal age to do so, according to Zhu.   The premier explained that old-age and unemployment insurance,   guarantee of basic livelihoods for laid-off workers and basic living   expenses for urban residents are the three complementary systems of the   Chinese-style social security mechanism under the present conditions.   In the long term, a comprehensive social security system covering all   workers will be set up, he said.',\n",

If I hadn't got   this one, I wouldn't have made it.''   Mantle was hospitalized May 28, and received a new liver June 8, two   days after he was placed on the list of patients in need of an organ   donor.   The transplant was done when doctors found Mantle had progressive liver   failure they linked to a small malignant tumor, more than 40 years of   excessive drinking, and a long dormant hepatitis C infection.   The 63-year-old Mantle was released from Baylor University Medical   Center in Dallas on Wednesday after continuing to show significant   improvement from the surgery. Mantle's doctors have said the former New   York Yankees slugger's outlook for recovery is good, despite signs that   his body has been slightly rejecting his transplanted liver.   Mantle told the Daily News he had no idea how serious his condition was   before he received the transplant.   ``I didn't even know what was going on,'' he said. ``I can't even   remember them telling me anything. One day I was hanging around, the   next thing I knew I was already operated on.''   For now, Mantle is resting at his youngest son Danny's home in North   Dallas, where he has been living because he is separated from his wife,   Merlyn, the younger Mantle told The Associated Press. He did not   elaborate.   ``He's doing really well,'' Danny Mantle said Saturday night. ``He's   still real weak. He can walk, but not real far. He tires out pretty   quick.''   Mantle's routine includes a daily trip to Baylor for blood tests and an   every-other-day regimen of steroids to help combat his body's rejection   of the new liver, his son said. Mantle also is scheduled for weekly   chemotherapy.   But he spends most of his days resting and watching TV.   ``He still watches the Yankees a lot, and we've watched the (Texas)   Rangers,'' Danny Mantle said. ``It's helped him a lot to get home   rather than being cooped up in the hospital.''   Mantle plans to have a news conference as soon as he gets his strength   back, his son said.   ``He doesn't want to do that until he feels he feels he can walk,''   Danny Mantle said. ``He can walk from room to room, but when we're at   the hospital I push him in a wheelchair. If he walks farther than 100   feet, he's pretty worn out.''   Mantle's physician Jeffrey Crippin, a liver specialist, said his   patient is tough.   ``He can't swing a golf club and I wouldn't give him a 35-ounce   (1-kilogram) bat to hit a baseball,'' Crippin said. ``But in a weird   sort of way, he's already hit a home run. The fact that he bounced back   so fast is a tribute to how tough he is.''\",\n",

Meanwhile up to 600 Chechen rebels massed in two villages a few   kilometres from Pervomaiskaya.   Russian television said the tanks left Russian-controlled Gudermes,   Chechnya\\'s second largest town, where bitter fighting erupted in   December. It lies about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Pervomaiskaya.   Russian special forces and regular troops were already surrounding the   Chechen rebels who had taken up defensive positions in Pervomaiskaya.   A reporter for Radio Liberty said he saw up to 600 Chechen separatists   mass in the villages of Engel Yurt and Kadi Yurt on the Chechen side of   the border.   They were armed with grenade launchers and assault rifles and were   ready to intervene if Russian troops attacked the hostage-takers, the   reporter told AFP after spending the night in one of the villages.   Russian artillery also moved towards Pervomaiskaya from a camp set up   nearby and helicopter gunships flew overhead all morning.   It was not clear whether Russian forces had launched an assault on the   village, where about 150 rebels were holed up with their hostages.   General Alexander Mikhailov, a spokesman for the Russian Federal   Security Service (FSB), told AFP near the village that the rebels were   holding 66 civilian hostages and 37 policemen who were acting as   \"volunteer\" human shields.   The rebels, who stormed the Dagestani town of Kizlyar at dawn Tuesday,   arrived in Pervomaiskaya with the hostages on board nine buses.

       " 'training-2147': {'body': \"   A U.S. negotiator has failed to persuade Serbian President Slobodan   Milosevic to recognize Bosnia's independence and plans to return to   Washington for more consultations, Western diplomats said Tuesday.   Robert Frasure, a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, ended a   week of talks with the powerful Serbian president on a plan to swap   recognition of Bosnia for lifting of economic sanctions on Yugoslavia.   Recognition of Bosnia would be a blow to rebel Serbs there and wreck   their dream of uniting all Serbs in one country. Milosevic armed and   financed the Bosnian Serbs before becoming a peacemaker in order to get   sanctions lifted.   Diplomats said the talks deadlocked over provisions for possible   reimposition of sanctions. Milosevic wants the U.N. Security Council to   have the final say, counting on his ally Russia's veto.   Milosevic has refused a U.S. proposal that an independent group of   experts decide, if needed, whether sanctions should be reintroduced.   Frasure was to leave for Washington Wednesday and brief the State   Department about the deadlock and possible next moves, the diplomats   said.   Milosevic apparently thinks that he has scored a big negotiating point   by pressuring the Bosnian Serbs to release U.N. hostages, proving he   can still influence them.   He is expected to stand firm on his proposal, which would virtually   ensure that sanctions are never reimposed.   Milosevic has also insisted on the right of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia _   Serbia and Montenegro _ to be the legal successor of the old Yugoslav   federation which disintegrated in war, sources familiar with the talks   said.   Yugoslavia could then claim all the assets of the old six-republic   federation.   The sources said Milosevic appeared to be willing to drop those demands   in exchange for the full lifting of a U.N. trade embargo imposed in   1992 for his support of rebel Serbs in Bosnia.   Economic sanctions have contributed to the collapse of the Yugoslav   economy. About half the workforce is unemployed and production has   plummeted. Many people live at or near the poverty line.   Sources say the package of incentives to Milosevic has been expanded to   include currency supports and credits.   Serbia's ability to bankroll Serb rebellions in Bosnia and Croatia has   been exhausted by the economic and political sanctions imposed in May   1992.   Talks with Frasure, opened April 29 and continued intermittently ever   since, were the most detailed between Milosevic and any outside   mediator since war erupted in Bosnia in 1992 after it seceded from   Yugoslavia.\",\n",

       " 'training-2149': {'body': \"   judgment,'' defense attorneys drew on surprising new witness   statements, blood evidence and exhibits to drum home their contention   that the wrong man is on trial.   Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. suggested to jurors Wednesday in   Simpson's double murder trial that the rush to judgment led prosecutors   to overlook or ignore key witnesses, physical evidence and other   suspects in the June 12 knife deaths of the former National Football   League star's ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman.   At the same time, Cochran in the defense's opening statements sought to   replace the image of a menacing, jealous wife beater with that of a   successful, busy man who had moved past his troubled relationship with   Nicole Brown Simpson.   ``This is a murder case,'' Cochran said. ``In their rush to win, they   tried to dredge up some theories to give you a motive, because they   don't have a motive.''   Cochran, for the first time, disclosed information about witnesses who   saw mysterious men at the crime scene on the night of the killings --   men one witness thinks may have been undercover police officers.   And there were more revelations, including one involving a couple who   walked past the crime scene about 10:25 p.m. and saw no bloody glove or   open gate.   Prosecutors contend the killings probably occurred about 10:15 p.m. --   the time a neighbor heard a dog's plaintive wail near the crime scene.   ``They tell us this about a dog's wail,'' Cochran said, indignation   rising in his voice, ``when a man's life's is at stake.''   Some of the defense's assertions were not new just to the jury, which   sat focused on Cochran's every word, but to prosecutors, as well.   At one point, a surprised look flashed on the face of prosecutor Marcia   Clark, who then scribbled a note to a colleague.   Prosecutors later complained to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance   Ito that defense attorneys obviously were withholding witness   statements from them, a violation of discovery rules.   The judge is expected to decide today what sanctions to impose against   the defense.   Earlier Wednesday, Ito ruled that television cameras could remain in   the courtroom as long as certain precautions were put in place that   would ensure that no juror's face would be sent out on the airwaves.   On Tuesday, Ito threatened to pull cameras permanently from the   courtroom because a Court TV camera accidentally picked up the face of   an alternate juror.   When trial resumes today, Cochran is expected to conclude his opening   statements, focusing on the Los Angeles Police Department's   investigation of the case and on DNA evidence.   Already, the defense attorney has countered Clark's reference to a   trail of blood -- which prosecutors contend lead to Simpson's guilt --   with trails of blood that he said the prosecution did not follow.   He said blood from inside Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernails and on her   thigh did not match Simpson's blood type or either victim's. The same   was true with blood found on a knife after the killings, he said.   Cochran told the jurors that fingerprints, palm prints and shoe prints   at the crime scene are not Simpson's.   He said the person who slashed the two victims should have been   saturated with blood, not left with the small amounts found on   Simpson's property and in his Ford Bronco.   ``There is no blood where there should be blood,'' Cochran said, ``and   that is devastating proof of innocence.''   Further, he said, a close-up autopsy photo of one of Ronald Goldman's   hands show signs of a physical fight.   Contrasted with that image were snapshots showing close-up views of   Simpson's face, neck, chest, back, arms, thighs and stomach after the   killings.   At one point, Simpson stood before the jurors, showing them scars that   several knee surgeries left behind.   Cochran said arthritis and knee problems limit Simpson's physical   movement -- suggesting he could not physically have committed the   murders.   Nor, he indicated to the jury, did Simpson have a reason to murder the   victims.   Cochran told jurors about Simpson's busy schedule, which included   coast-to-coast flights, charitable fund-raisers and other concerns, and   a new girlfriend, Paula Barbieri.   The attorney portrayed Simpson as a man who grew up from modest   beginnings and never forget his background, a man who secretly gave   back to the neighborhood from where he came, a man whose generosity   extended to Nicole Brown Simpson and her family.   Since the 1989 incident in which Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal   battery, Cochran told the jury, the defendant never again physically   abused his wife.   (STORY CAN END HERE.

However, it said, the U.N. observer mission turned a blind eye to this   situation and paid no attention to the government report in this regard   which leads to the re-arm of UNITA and putting the southern African   country on the brink of an all-out civil war.   The statement appreciated the position taken by the Southern African   Development Community which had announced UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi   as a \"war criminal\" and that talks with the patriotic UNITA Renovation   Committee is the only way to end the peace process.   The Angolan government urged the U.N. to accept the stand and give up   its illusions on Savimbi in a bid to achieve real and lasting peace in   the war-torn country.   Moreover, the government called on the army, national police and all   peace-loving people to be mobilized and destroy Savimbi\\'s war machines.   Since mid-November, the government army clashed heatedly with UNITA   forces in central Huambo and Bie provinces. The former rebel movement   which had been equipped with tanks, armored carriers, long-range   cannons and ground-to-air missiles forced the government army to   retreat in defeat several times and have to hold on to the two capital   cities of Huambo and Kuito.   UNITA\\'s powerful war facilities have been a surprise to the government   which in turn voiced its dissatisfaction with the inefficient   supervision of the U.N. mission.   Angola\\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said earlier that the   government is considering the withdrawal of U.N. observers mission from   the country.',\n",

Athens on Saturday officially lifted the economic embargo it   unilaterally imposed on Skopje 18 months ago in a row over the name of   the former Yugoslav republic, as well as its constitution and flag,   which Greece said implied territorial aims over its northern province   of the same name.   But on Monday, cross-border trade was still slow in picking up as no   trailer trucks or trains had yet crossed the Greek-Macedonian border.   \"There are technical questions that remain to be settled but everything   will resume this week,\" a customs official at the Evzones border post   said.   He said that in all about 30 private Macedonian cars, holding about 50   people, have crossed the border since the weekend, mostly young people   wanting to visit Greece or businessmen.   Among articles in the memorandum was one specifying that trailer trucks   from both countries, traveling either to Greece or Macedonia or   crossing through these countries, will not be subject to taxes or be   required to submit any special permits.   Spokesman Telemaque Hytiris on Monday said this was a \"major   development for Greek transport to central and northern Europe.\"   The memorandum also said that until liaison offices are opened, visas   will be delivered at the border on ready-made forms. The visa for entry   into Greece will refer to residents of the Former Yugoslav Republic of   Macedonia (FYROM), using the provisional name under which Skopje was   admitted to the United Nations in 1993.   The two countries, which signed an accord in New York on September 13   in which Macedonia agreed to alter its flag and constitution, are still   at loggerheads over Macedonia\\'s name.

Accompanied by top commanders of the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in   Lebanon, Bashar Assad, the son of Syrian President Hafez Assad, met   Lebanon's president at his palace, apparently to press for quick   appointment of a prime minister and formation of a new Cabinet.   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri resigned Friday. He accused his   half-Christian, half-Muslim Cabinet of hampering his dlrs 18 million   program to rebuild Lebanon after the 1975-90 civil war.   The resignation of the 50-year-old Sunni Muslim billionaire was seen as   a maneuver to oust the ministers hindering his policies.   President Elias Hrawi was expected to reappoint Hariri, who has wide   support in parliament.   In an important sign, Nabih Berri, a Shiite Muslim whose Amal militia   was a main Syrian ally in the civil war, has backed Hariri's   reappointment.   The government and Parliament are largely packed with Syria's   supporters, but squabbles over the distribution of key portfolios and   the exclusion of Hariri's critics could lead Syria to intervene in the   formation of a Cabinet.   Hariri has been credited with stabilizing Lebanon's currency since he   took office in October 1992, and many Lebanese see him as the only hope   for reconstruction.   But living standards have worsened, triggering anti-government strikes   and opposition charges of corruption.\",\n",

It was another dismal outcome for Bush at his final NATO summit as he   sought to polish his wretched warmongering foreign policy legacy.   \"I thought I had those NATO monkeys eating out of my hand,\" sniffled   Bush in an exclusive interview with FMLiveWire. \"NATO is following my   orders by destroying Afghanistan so why the hell won\\'t those poodles   roll over on this one?\"   The decision was cheered by Moscow which opposes NATO\\'s eastward   expansion into its former republics.   NATO was split by opposition among European allies, with France and   Germany deciding not to suck up to the USA.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not even OK plans for an   anti-missile, anti-Russia missile shield in Europe.   The NATO summit didn\\'t even express confidence in its mission in   Afghanistan.   \"NATO thugs are busy bombing the hell out of Afghanistan to make that   Bush-monkey happy and to help grab oil in Central Asia and pressure   Russia,\" one NATO official confidentially snorted. \"Jesus this Afghan   smack is good stuff!\"   NATO has about 47,000 troops in Afghanistan, but gutless commanders   particularly from Canada are begging for more troops in the south,   where Taliban insurgents are winning the war. The US has about 14,000   troops for NATO there, plus another 13,000 stomping the Afghans in   eastern Afghanistan.   Bush said Russia should not fear NATO, but rather should welcome the   alliance because it \"is a group of nations dedicated to warmongering   and propping up the dying US empire by whatever means and buying our   crappy overpriced weapons with sinking US dollars.\"   Special NATO guest Ron Paul then spoke, saying, \"I rise in opposition   to the further expansion of NATO to the borders of Russia. NATO is an   organization whose purpose ended with the end of its Warsaw Pact   adversary. When NATO struggled to define its future after the Cold War,   it settled on attacking an innocent sovereign state, Yugoslavia, which   had neither invaded nor threatened any NATO member state.\"   \"This current round of NATO expansion is a political reward to   governments in Georgia and Ukraine that came to power as a result of   US-supported revolutions, the so-called Orange Revolution and Rose   Revolution,\" Paul continued. \"The governments that arose from these   street protests were eager to please their US sponsor and the US, in   turn, turned a blind eye to the numerous political and human rights   abuses that took place under the new regimes. Thus the US policy of   \"exporting democracy\" has only succeeding in exporting more misery to   the countries it has targeted.\"   Paul said, \"NATO expansion only benefits the US military industrial   complex, which stands to profit from expanded arms sales to new NATO   members. The \"modernization\" of former Soviet militaries in Ukraine and   Georgia will mean tens of millions in sales to US and European military   contractors. The US taxpayer will be left holding the bill, as the US   government will subsidize most of the transactions.\"   As NATO officials fell asleep, Paul shouted, \"Providing US military   guarantees to Ukraine and Georgia can only further strain our military.   This NATO expansion may well involve the US military in conflicts as   unrelated to our national interest as the breakaway regions of South   Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia. The idea that American troops might be   forced to fight and die to prevent a small section of Georgia from   seceding is absurd and disturbing.\"   \"NATO should thus be disbanded, not expanded,\" Paul concluded.

Doull, making his only appearance on the tour in place of the injured   Chris Cairns, grabbed three wickets in two overs as the Indians made   heavy weather of chasing a moderate target of 127 in the decider.   Slammed for 27 runs in his first two overs, the bald Doull hit back by   removing Vinod Kambli, skipper Mohammad Azharuddin and Sanjay Manjrekar   in the space of six deliveries to raise visions of an upset win.   But the Indians held their ground to cruise home with 18 overs to spare   and complete a grand double, following their 1-0 win in the rain-hit   three-Test series.   Doull\\'s spell livened up a seemingly one-sided contest after the Kiwis,   without the injured Martin Crowe, folded up for a meagre 126 in 35   overs, their lowest one-day score against India.   The match was played in the shadow of Sunday\\'s tragedy in Nagpur, where   10 fans were killed and 70 others injured when a stadium wall collapsed   during the previous international.   Still, some 40,000 spectators turned up at the Brabourne stadium, a   test venue till 1972, to witness the match, earmarked as a benefit game   for former Indian wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.   They had reason to celebrate as New Zealand, whose 348 for eight in   Nagpur was the third highest score ever in limited-overs cricket, were   bundled out 16 short of their previous lowest total against India --   142 at Auckland last year.   Skipper Lee Germon\\'s 29 was the top score against the steady attack in   which spinners Anil Kumble and Ashish Kapoor shared five wickets. The   agile Azharuddin chipped in with two run outs.   When India began their reply, Danny Morrison gave New Zealand the   initial breakthrough by bowling Sachin Tendulkar for one in the third   over.   Left-handed Kambli made 48, taking 16 off Doull\\'s second over, before   falling to a brilliant diving catch by Mark Greatbatch in the bowler\\'s   next over.   Fired by his first success, Doull had Azharuddin caught behind, and   Manjrekar taken at square leg, in his fourth over as India slipped to   75 for four by the 15th.   The fifth-wicket pair of Manoj Prabhakar and Ajay Jadeja denied New   Zealand further success, but struggled for 17 overs to score the   remaining 52 runs for victory.   \"It was a timely win, especially since this was our last match before   the World Cup\" said Azharuddin, under whom India have not lost a home   series in both test and one-day cricket since 1990.   \"The boys are confidently looking forward to the World Cup. That\\'s the   ultimate prize. God willing, we will win that one too, but we have to   work hard on our fielding,\" the Indian skipper said.   New Zealand manager Glen Turner complimented the Indians, and said the   tour had given his young team first-hand experience of what to expect   during the World Cup.   \"The tour was a good education for the players. They rallied together   in unfamiliar conditions, and will be better off when they return here   in two months for the World Cup,\" Turner said.   Indian seamer Javagal Srinath won the man of the match award for his   two early wickets in New Zealand\\'s innings. Prabhakar was declared the   man of the series.',\n",

But Japan says it   has plenty of vaccine to go around, so the aid is sitting unused in the   United States.   To some critics, the stalemate over the offer by AmeriCares of New   Canaan, Conn., is an illustration of Japanese red tape in the wake of   the devastating Jan. 17 quake that killed at least 5,273 people.   But to Japanese officials, the moral of the story is different: Japan   was offered aid it never asked for and doesn't need, they say, and now   it's being criticized for not accepting it.   It's not the first time foreign aid for the quake victims has touched   off controversy. Critics have complained that petty bureaucratic rules   were preventing foreign help from reaching victims; in one case,   foreign doctors were prevented from seeing patients for a day because   they didn't have Japanese medical licenses.   The United States offered to house evacuees on an aircraft carrier but   was turned down by the Japanese government, even though refugees later   took shelter on a Japanese passenger boat.   The vaccine case, however, could be different.   ``At this point, we can provide for our needs with the vaccine we   have,'' said Miki Fujiwara of the health department in the hardest-hit   city of Kobe.   Officials in Kobe and the Health and Welfare Ministry said only people   over 65 are being encouraged to receive the vaccine. Younger people   don't need to be vaccinated because they're unlikely to become   seriously ill even if they catch the flu, said the ministry's Yoshinobu   Hirayama.   So far, flu hasn't become a serious epidemic, despite the chilly   conditions in many of the emergency shelters.   Some of the misunderstanding may stem from different views of how   vaccinations should be used. Japanese officials stress the possible   side effects, noting that people with colds may also develop a fever   after being vaccinated.   That's why only about 100 to 200 people are receiving the flu shots   each day in Kobe, Fujiwara said.   But Andrew Hannah, executive vice president of AmeriCares, said: ``You   want to immunize as many people as you possibly can'' to prevent   epidemics from spreading. He added, however, that ``you have to defer''   to Japan's judgment of what health measures are necessary.   Hannah said AmeriCares offered the flu vaccines to Japan because it had   a large supply available from a donor drug company that had surplus   vaccines in stock.   Since the vaccine takes several weeks to have an effect, no one knows   now who is right. Fujiwara contended a flu epidemic will be unlikely in   several weeks time because the weather will be warmer and many people   will have moved out of crowded refugee shelters.   But the complexity of the situation hasn't stopped critics of the   government from jumping in to attack. Officials of the main opposition   party in Parliament, the New Frontier Party, contacted foreign   journalists last week to present the vaccine case as an illustration of   incompetence by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's government.   ``They are incapable of managing emergencies,'' said Yukinori Murayama,   an aide to opposition legislator Yuriko Koike.\",\n",

       " 'training-1394': {'body': \"   The Jerusalem municipality plans a new Jewish neighborhood in the   city's contested eastern sector, a deputy mayor said Wednesday.   The plan comes amid heated debate over the holy city sparked by last   month's announcement of plans to confiscate Palestinian land for a   different Jewish neighborhood and a congressional initiative to move   the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   Deputy Mayor Shmuel Meir said the decision to build the 400 new Jewish   homes was made in principle three years ago, but building was delayed   due to the contractor's refusal to pay city taxes.   The daily Haaretz said the contractor, Jack Nasser, bought the land   from Arabs and was demanding a discount from the city. Meir said he did   not know how much the contractor owed and it was not clear exactly how   much land was involved.   ``Once he pays, the building will go ahead,'' Meir said.   The site lies between the Jewish neighborhood Armon Hanaziv and the   Arab village Jabel Mukaber, an area of Israeli-Arab tensions during the   six-year Palestinian uprising that ended in 1993.   Meir also said there was another proposal to confiscate 81 hectares   (200 acres) between the east Jerusalem neighborhoods Pisgat Zeev and   French Hill.   It was not clear if that would be part of a plan announced Tuesday by   Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer to confiscate another 300 acres   (121 hectares) of Arab-owned land.   More confiscations could be disastrous for the peace talks with the   Palestinians after an uproar over last month's announcement of plans to   confiscate 140 acres (57 hectares) of partly Arab-owned land in east   Jerusalem.   The PLO and Arab states have called on the U.N. Security Council to   investigate those confiscations, and the militant Hamas movement called   for revenge attacks against Israelis.   Ir Shalem, an dovish Israeli group, issued a statement Wednesday   contradicting Ben-Eliezer's claim that 28 percent of the land whose   confiscation was announced in April was owned by Arabs and 62 percent   by Jews. The group said 80 percent of the land is owned by Palestinians   and only 17 percent by Jews.   Sheik Ahmed Baher of Hamas on Wednesday termed the confiscations ``a   challenge to the feelings of Muslims.''   Any building in east Jerusalem, by Palestinians and Israelis, is   contentious, since both sides lay claim to the area.   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and annexed it into   its capital. The Palestinians claim the sector as a future capital.   Talks over the city's final status are to start by May 1996.   But the Palestinians contend Israel is trying to change the city's   status quo by confiscating Arab land and building Jewish housing.   Already, Jews slightly outnumber the 155,000 Arabs in the eastern   sector.   In an effort to ease tensions, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Tuesday   proposed confiscating land for building Arab neighborhoods.   Ahmed Tibi, an aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, rejected such   an offer Wednesday.   ``We are against any confiscation of Arab land in east Jerusalem. We   don't believe any declaration about building for Arabs,'' Tibi told   Israel Radio.   Ir Shalem also rejected the idea, saying it ``indicates an inadequate   grasp of the complexity and the sensitivities of the property issues in   Jerusalem.''   The group's statement also said more than one third of the 70 square   kilometers of East Jerusalem have been expropriated since 1967, and 85   percent of that land was owned by Palestinians.   In a speech in Gaza marking the start of Muslims' four-day Feast of the   Sacrifice Wednesday, PLO chief Yasser Arafat repeated his aspiration to   see east Jerusalem capital of a Palestinian state.   ``The Palestinian people have taken its destiny into their own hands   with faith and patience to build the nation stone by stone until the   victorious flags of Palestine are hoisted over the fences of   Jerusalem,'' Arafat said.   Also Wednesday, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti was   quoted as telling a newspaper Israel's intended land confiscation could   damage bilateral relations.   ``This will make the peace process vulnerable to doubts and mistrust   and will not help us complete the process on a popular level,''   Kabariti told the daily Davar. ga/dmc-dp\",\n",

However, the central bank said this will depend on improvement in the   country's infrastructure, especially the dilapidated road network,   security and increased efficiency of public services.   The bank's Monthly Economic Review for April said the 12 month to   January 1999 showed an expanded GDP of 1.7 percent.   This expanded growth has been achieved from improved agricultural   production that has benefited from good weather conditions in the past   six months compared to early 1998 when the El Nino rains destroyed   crops, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.   Statistics from the bank indicate that the agricultural sector recorded   a 1.7 percent growth from the end of last year to early this year   compared to 1.2 percent achieved in the same period last year, mainly   owing to good weather conditions.   The bank also noted that the manufacturing sector and tourism industry   experienced no much progress in the past 12 months.

The 40-foot-long (12-meter) container reached Hamburg, Germany's   busiest port, on Wednesday aboard the Hong Kong-registered freighter   CGM Magellan, police said.   It had started its journey in the Colombian port of Buenaventura,   addressed to a Hamburg company whose name police did not release.   The company had been investigated but no one was arrested, police said.   The freight bill with the inexact notation of leather strips caused   customs officers to take drug-sniffing dogs to check the container   Thursday morning.   ``There were plastic shoes and leather bits right behind the door but   directly behind that were sacks with the marijuana,'' said Hamburg   customs spokesman Sigmund Zwirn.   The gross weight of the seized two-kilogram (4.4-pound) sacks was 21   tons, he said, and the net weight of the marijuana was at least 16 tons   with an estimated retail value of 160 million marks or about dlrs 100   million.   Zwirn said the smugglers had not taken special measures to disguise the   shipment, and drug-sniffing dogs would have discovered it even without   the suspicion of the customs officers.   But since about 2 million containers annually pass through the busy   North Sea port, customs police are not able to check a large percentage   of the freight and believe their rate of drug finds is rather low.   De La Motte said, however, that Thursday's big find was proof that even   such a big port as Hamburg has some controls.\",\n",

After that, they would be   called to the IBF offices in East Orange, in the suburbs of New York   City, to bid for the right to promote the fight.   Foreman's promoter is Bob Arum, while Schulz's is Cedric Kushner.   The IBF raised Schulz's ranking from No. 9 contender to No. 2 at the   meeting.   ``He took Foreman to the wall last time,'' Roseman said.   The winner would be required to fight No. 1 contender Franz Botha of   South Africa, Roseman said.   Because of his age, Foreman must submit to an extensive physical by Dr.   Barry Jordan of the New York State Athletic Commission 30 days before   fighting, Roseman said.   ``If they don't meet these conditions the IBF will strip Foreman of his   title,'' Roseman said. He said the IBF expects Foreman and Arum to   agree to the terms.   Foreman lost the WBA title for refusing to fight Tony Tucker when   Tucker was the associations's No. 1 contender.   Foreman won the titles by knocking out Michael Moorer in November.   Roseman said a 120-day extension would be granted for the rematch if   requested and probably would be necessary if the fight is held in the   United States to avoid competing with the World Series and other fall   sporting events.\",\n",

He said that Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf would   accompany Ramadam to express Baghdad\\'s views at the OIC summit.   However, Samarmad did not specify what proposals the Iraqi delegation   would deliver to the OIC summit.   Referring to relations between Iraq and Iran, Samarmad said that   Baghdad was ready to improve its relations with Iran since Iranian   President Mohammad Khatami has voiced Tehran\\'s willingness to develop   friendly ties with neighboring countries.   He said that the Iraqi government has taken positive steps to improve   relations with Iran by allowing Iranian citizens to pay religious   pilgrimage to the Shiite shrines in southern Iraq.   It is the Iranian authorities that did not issue permission for Iranian   citizens to visit Iraq, Samarmad said, however, hundreds of overseas   Iranians travel to southern Iraq every day through other countries.   The Iraqi diplomat also rejected the Iranian accusation that Baghdad   still holds more than 15,000 Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) of the   Iran-Iraq war, saying that Iraq has released all Iranian POWs.   Iran has said that during the past years, it has released several   hundreds of Iraqi POWs as \"unilateral humanitarian measures to solve   the POW issue between the two country.\"   Iran repeatedly accused Iraq of giving no response to Iran\\'s goodwill   gesture.',\n",

During his meeting with Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Avraham   Burg in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat said both Israelis and   Palestinians should work together with U.S., Egyptian and the European   Union envoys to advance the deadlocked talks.   Burg stressed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is committed to   the peace process and will try his best to reach peace treaties with   both Syria and the Palestinians.   Earlier, Burg's spokesman said his meetings with Arafat and other   senior Palestinian officials were aiming at establishing direct   channels of communications between them.   Friday's meeting was the first between Arafat and a senior Israeli   political figure since his summit meeting with Barak last month failed   to resolve differences over Israeli troops withdrawal map from 6.1   percent of the West Bank land.   The two sides also missed a February 13 deadline for a framework   agreement on final peace as stipulated by the Sharm el Sheikh   memorandum signed last September.

       " 'training-0365': {'body': '   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi has come out of the bush to visit   the Zairean town of Gbadolite, raising UN hopes of putting an end to 20   years of civil war.   UN special envoy to Angola Alouine Blondin Beye told AFP here that the   first foreign trip by the head of the armed opposition UNITA in three   years showed a \"fundamental change of approach\" on his part.   \"Savimbi has come out of his logic of confinement,\" Blondin Beye said.   \"The next step will be a meeting with President (Jose Eduardo) Dos   Santos\" to press ahead with implementation of a peace pact signed last   November in the Zambian capital Lusaka.   Blondin Beye said that the date and location for the meeting -- the   first between the rival leaders since Angola plunged back into civil   war in October 1992 -- had already been decided on, but should remain   secret \"until the two men are sitting face to face in the same room\".   In Gbadolite, where Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko generally   resides, Savimbi was not boiling with enthusiasm at the prospect of   meeting Dos Santos and has for the moment ruled out \"going to the   others\\' place\".   \"I don\\'t plan to be a tourist in Luanda,\" the Angolan capital, he said.   The conflict, which has cost more than 500,000 lives, resumed after the   National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) lost   general elections held under a first, May 1991 peace accord to the   ruling People\\'s Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA)   Savimbi said he was not behind the plan to meet Dos Santos and was   doing so at the behest of the international community.   \"For a long time, president Savimbi lived in the bush, entirely cut off   from the world and surrounded by a pack of courtiers who concealed the   reality from him, telling hin each day that he was the biggest and the   strongest,\" one anonymous UN official said.   \"But those days are over. Savimbi knows that he can never win the war,\"   the official added. According to the United Nations, UNITA controls   only 15 percent of Angolan territory, as compared with 70 percent a   year ago. The movement has also lost almost all its outside support,   though it was once backed by the United States and apartheid South   Africa against the then Marxist regime in Luanda.   Blondin Beye said the Angolan government is \"today in a position to   crush UNITA militarily\", but the international community had stepped up   pressure on Luanda not to humiliate the rebel leader.   \"Since November 22 (when a new ceasefire took effect), there has been   no fighting between the two sides\", though at its height, the \"Angolan   civil war was claiming more than a thousand lives a day,\" Blondin Beye   said.   Nevertheless, violations of the ceasefire have been reported by both   sides, threatening to delay the deployment in May of 7,000 peacekeeping   troops the UN Security Council has agreed to deploy to help monitor a   military and political settlement, under which UNITA would get a number   of government and administrative posts.   For Blondin Beye, \"the first part of the process has been completed\"   and the rival armies have pulled back from their front lines, where in   some places \"they were only 50 metres (yards) apart\".   \"Logistical problems remain, notably of communication,\" the UN envoy   said. \"But you don\\'t end 20 years of war by blowing a whistle.\"   The UN troops are due to oversee the disarmament of some 60,000 UNITA   soldiers before a new, joint army is formed to replace the current MPLA   force of some 100,000 men.   The political aspect of the Lusaka protocol will only take effect after   the military side has been dealt with, Beye said.   Another problem is repairing the damage to the southern African nation   caused by the war. More than a third of some 10 million Angolans are   internally displaced or live in exile and the country is the most mined   in the world. UN officials believe there are more than 10 million mines   on its soil.   \"If all goes well, the Angolan farmes will return to their fields in   two years time,\" Blondin Beye said.',\n",

       " 'training-0363': {'body': '   A South Korean newspaper created a minor flap here Thursday with a   front page report that US troops were preparing to pull out of South   Korea.   The report, carried by the Joong-Ang Daily, said mid-level planning had   begun for the phased pull-out of the 37,000 US forces here.   It set phones ringing non-stop at the main US base in Seoul, drew an   instant denial from the US 8th Army, and a more circumspect denial from   the South Korean Foreign Ministry.   \"Neither the US embassy nor the US Forces Korea have been apprised of   such a plan,\" said the 8th Army release hastily faxed to foreign and   domestic news offices throughout Seoul.   \"The story presented ... is absolutely wrong and irresponsible,\" it   said.   A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman denied the report as   \"groundless\" but said that Washington obviously planned to withdraw in   the long run, while the national Yonhap news agency churned out a spate   of comments by government officials.   \"Right now there is no discussion on the withdrawal of US Forces, but   the issue will be revived as a matter of practical concern for us   sooner or later,\" the agency quoted an unnamed senior official as   saying, refering to the nuclear thaw.   The South Korean government feels a new safe-guard system is needed in   preparation for the eventual withdrawal, which is why it is considering   signing a peace treaty with North Korea, the official said.   Joon-Ang said the withdrawal planning was underway in line with the   Nunn-Warner bill passed by Congress in 1990, which projected a three   phase troop withdrawal through the year 2000.   The first phase withdrawal, of 7,000 troops, was completed in 1992 when   usually-hostile relations between North and South Korea eased in a   flurry of high-level bilateral meetings.   The massive joint defensive exercise \"Team Spirit\" was also cancelled   in 1992 amid the thaw, which lasted only until 1993 when the North   Korean military standoff fuelled mounting tensions.   Robert Gallucci, the top US negotiator with North Korea, and US Defence   Secretary William Perry have both said in the past month they are   aiming for a reduction in US forces.   But both have stressed that no move will be made until the North pulls   back the thousands of troops and artillery it has massed just North of   the Demilitarized Zone.   Perry, a strong advocate of \"fight-and-talk\" tactics, stressed here   last month that despite the easing of nuclear tensions due to the   signing of the October 21 Geneva accord which freezes the North\\'s   nuclear program, the North\\'s million strong standing army still posed a   major threat.   Most US ground forces in South Korea are in trip-wire positions just   south of the DMZ.',\n",

       " 'training-0362': {'body': '   Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with South African President   Thabo Mbeki here on Tuesday to discuss a range of regional and   international issues of common concern.   Both leaders agreed that cooperation between the two countries was   complementary in many fields and had great potentials for further   expansion.   This, they said, called for a high-level mechanism to guide and   coordinate such cooperation in various fields.   Jiang said the establishment of diplomatic ties in early 1998 paved the   way for cooperation between China and South Africa.   He said China and South Africa, both as developing countries, exerted   great influence in the Asian and African regions respectively and   shared a common goal of safeguarding the interests of developing   countries and pushing for the building-up of a just and reasonable new   international order.   Jiang said promoting and deepening Sino-South African cooperation   conformed with the long-term and fundamental interests of both   countries and would benefit world peace and development as well.   He stressed that China, which attached importance to the unique role   played by South Africa in regional and international affairs, expected   to develop long-term, stable and friendly cooperative ties with South   Africa.   Close cooperation between the two countries, he noted, was particularly   important at a time when chauvinism and power politics posed a threat   to world peace and security.   He lauded Mbeki\\'s concept of \"African Renaissance\", saying this idea   was a follow-up and development of Pan-Africanism pursued by the old   generation of African leaders.   Jiang said the idea, which reflected the sense of responsibility   displayed by South Africa to strive for the revival of the African   continent, would contribute to peace and development in Africa.   Mbeki, extending his warm welcome to Jiang, said his visit, the first   by a Chinese head of state since the establishment of diplomatic   relations, was of great significance to the development of bilateral   ties.   He said South Africa and China could cooperate in many fields and such   cooperation was important for the development of South Africa.   Mbeki said there are no problems between South Africa and China which   enjoyed good cooperation. The only challenge for the two countries, he   said, was how to enhance bilateral ties to a higher level of vitality.   Cooperation between South Africa and China served as a good example for   other developing countries seeking inter-state cooperation, he said.   Mbeki stressed that South Africa and China should cooperate more   closely with other developing countries so as to exert positive   influence on the setting up of a new international economic order. He   reiterated South African support for China to join the World Trade   Organization at an earliest date possible.   Jiang arrived in South Africa on Monday for a four-day state visit, the   last leg of his five-nation tour which has brought him to Israel,   Palestine, Turkey and Greece. During his stopover in Alexandria, Egypt,   Jiang also met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.',\n",

We talked about what happened and he said (his   arrest) came as no surprise to him ... He knew something was to come,''   Danish neo-Nazi leader Jonni Hansen told The Associated Press.   The Dane visited Lauck Thursday afternoon at a jail in Roskilde, 40   kilometers (25 miles) west of Copenhagen.   Lauck's U.S.-based organization ``doesn't depend on Lauck. Others will   take over his job,'' Hansen said.   Lauck, of Lincoln, Nebraska, is head of the National Socialist German   Workers Party--Overseas Organization. He has been sought for years by   German authorities for supplying anti-Semitic newspapers and leaflets   in Germany.   Last week, Lauck showed up at Hansen's home in Hundige, some 20   kilometers (12 miles) south of Copenhagen. He was arrested Monday by   Danish police, at Germany's request.   Hansen, head of Denmark's National Socialist Movement, claimed he   didn't know Lauck was sought when the American arrived ``as a guest in   my house'' around March 13. He did not say where Lauck came from.   The Danish neo-Nazi, head of Denmark's National Socialist Movement,   compared Lauck's ``peculiar arrest'' to the persecution of British   writer Salman Rushdie, who is facing an Iranian religious death order.   ``If I should draw a parallel, it would be as if Salman Rushdie visited   Denmark and he was arrested by Danish police, who would extradite him   to Iran,'' Hansen said.   Last Monday, eight police officers -- three in uniforms -- arrested   Lauck at Hansen's home, a bungalow hidden behind a tall wooden fence   and boarded windows. He was not handcuffed when arrested at 4:15 p.m.   (1545 gmt), Hansen said.   No others were arrested.   Hansen claimed Lauck's group ``has not been knocked out because of the   arrest. ... Lauck has just been removed, and that is a loss but he is   not irreplaceable.''   But Frede Farmand Rasmussen, a Danish historian researching neo-Nazis   in Denmark, said Canadian extremist Ernst Zuendel likely would become   Lauck's successor.   Contrary to Hansen's claims, Lauck's arrest was a ``major blow'' to the   distribution of right-wing propaganda to Germany, Farmand Rasmussen   said.\",\n",

Australia recently pledged 2.5 million Australian dollars (roughly 1.9   million US) and New Zealand 100,000 New Zealand dollars (70,000 US), he   said.   Ross said that a total of 18 million dollars has been pledged in the   yearlong appeal so far, or 43 percent of the goal, he told AFP.   \"It\\'s not bad\" for this early stage of the appeal, he said.   The WFP announced in early February an emergency appeal to provide   North Korea with 100,000 tonnes of food, enough to feed 1.7 million   North Koreans including 600,000 children under five who are threatened   by famine.   The United States was the first to answer it, pledging 10 million   dollars, followed by South Korea, with six million.   North Korea has been struggling with food shortages due to massive   flooding that has wiped out harvests over the past two years and   sparked fears of a famine of the scale that devastated Ethiopia in the   mid-1980s.   The North Koreans themselves predict the crisis will come in June, he   said, but \"most people expect that they will run out sooner than that.\"   Catherine Bertini, executive director of the Rome-based UN agency, will   head a delegation of WFP officials visiting North Korea on March 15-18,   Ross said.

Some 250,000 Georgian civilians fled Abkhazia during the conflict, and   Tbilisi has demanded their repatriation as a condition for a peace   settlement.

       " 'training-0160': {'body': \"   On a visit to France's former African colonies beginning Wednesday,   President Jacques Chirac aims to firm up ties with both strongmen and   democratic leaders to boost trade and national prestige.   Reformers are hoping the bad old days of coddled dictators don't   return, but French businessmen fear losing trade to American companies   and argue favoring economic development over more democracy.   Insiders say that's sparked a policy struggle in Chirac's two-month-old   government as the conservative president embarks Wednesday on a six-day   trip in which he'll meet 15 heads of state.   While French business with Africa has fallen to a few percentage points   of France's overall foreign trade, it has an estimated 30 billion franc   (dlrs 6 billion) trade surplus with Africa, according to the Council of   French Investors in Africa.   Chirac, who has waged an aggressive neo-Gaullist foreign policy by   insisting on nuclear testing and a tougher stance in Bosnia, also aims   to plant France's flag firmly in Africa.   ``For France, one of the signs of power is to be present in Africa,''   said Philippe Moreau de Farges, a researcher for the French Institute   for International Relations.   Chirac starts with a two-day stop in Morocco, where France has   maintained close links with King Hassan II as a bastion against Muslim   fundamentalism.   France supports Hassan for ``promoting a moderate, tolerant Islam,''   Chirac spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told a briefing Tuesday.   Chirac, who was to remain in contact with Paris on Bosnia, planned to   discuss the crisis with Hassan, said Colonna. Hassan was to meet on   Bosnia with Muslim foreign ministers Friday, though Chirac leaves a day   earlier and had no plans to send an emissary, she said.   Chirac wouldn't press Hassan hard on the Western Sahara, the   mineral-rich territory Morocco controls and wants to annex.   ``We support U.N. efforts to promote an equitable and durable   settlement,'' Colonna said, referring to a planned referendum in which   the Polisario independence movement is disputing voter registration   with Moroccan authorities.   Chirac did plan to meet with opposition figures in Morocco, though not   in sub-Saharan Africa, Colonna said.   The French president flies Friday to the Ivory Coast, France's chief   African trading partner, where he is to meet President Henri Konan   Bedier along with the leaders of Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger.   The next day he flies to oil-rich Gabon, hosted by strongman President   Omar Bongo. They are to be joined by the leaders of Chad, oil-rich   Cameroon, Congo and the Central African Republic.   On Sunday, Chirac goes to Senegal for meetings with President Abdou   Diouf and the leaders of Guinea, Mauritania and Mali.   Colonna noted 12 of the 14 leaders Chirac would meet were elected,   though the opposition has contested some votes. Chirac would nudge   leaders toward further reform, she said.   ``Progress has been made in democratization, but it must be deepened,''   Colonna said.   Chirac's entourage includes Jacques Foccart. Known as ``Mr. Africa,''   the 82-year-old former adviser under Charles de Gaulle was the   architect of France's neo-colonial policies that maintained Bongo and   other friendly leaders in power after independence.   Observers and government sources say Chirac, who skipped naming Foccart   as his chief African adviser, is tapping him for his expertise and   contacts.   Chirac ``is taken between two tendencies _ Premier Alain Juppe and   Foccart, which are contradictory,'' said Francois Xavier, president of   the advocacy group Survival.   A source close to Chirac, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted the   two camps were fighting for Chirac's ear.   Xavier and the source said they believe Juppe, who backs reform to   fight corruption and wean African countries from a deficit-ridden   French government, seems to have the upper hand.   ``It is not impossible that the Juppe line wins,'' Xavier said.   But French companies are hoping Chirac goes easy on democratic reform,   said Jean-Louis Castelnau, delegate general of the Council of French   Investors in Africa, representing 100 companies.   ``If we want to talk about economic improvement, we need strong   governments,'' he said.   ``There is a real worry'' about American companies if France eases its   support of African governments, he said. ``We see a push by the   Anglo-Saxons in oil, gas and mines in Francophone Africa.''\",\n",

The prime minister would have meeting and detail talks with President   Clinton at the White House on October 17 on matters of bilateral,   regional and international interests. She will also hold meeting with   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General Ms.   Janet Reno.   A number of agreements, including one on peaceful use of nuclear   energy, are likely to be signed during her stay in Washington at a time   when ties between the two sides are being reshaped in the post-cold-war   era.   Shafi Sami said some other elements of the program are being worked   out. Giving a preview of Hasina's talks with Clinton in Washington, the   foreign secretary said this would be a second summit of the two leaders   in less then six months.   This not only underscores President Clinton's continued interest in   Bangladesh but also reflects the desire of the U.S. government to   reinvigorate bilateral dialogue and cooperation with Bangladesh on a   range of common issues and interests.

       " 'training-0169': {'body': '   Japanese business confidence deteriorated in August with the diffusion   index for large manufacturers falling from minus three points in May to   minus seven, the Bank of Japan said in a quarterly report Wednesday.   The central bank had forecast the diffusion index at zero in its last   short-term \"Tankan\" survey of economic enterprises released in June.   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar rose sharply from   107.75 yen immediately prior to the announcement to 108.12 yen, dealers   said.   Dealers said the weaker-than-expected outcome prompted immediate dollar   buying support. Market consensus was for a modest improvement in the   August Tankan to zero.   The index measures the difference between the number of responses with   a positive outlook towards the economy minus those with negative   projections in the survey of more than 10,000 companies.   The Bank of Japan forecast its next quarterly Tankan in November would   show an index of zero, the first time the index has been out of   negative territory in four years and nine months.   Central bank officials told reporters the index showed the first   deterioration in a year, since it fell to minus-18 in August 1995 from   minus-16 in the previous survey.   The Bank of Japan said the August level was the lowest since the   February survey, when the index stood at minus-12.   In the August survey, the index for non-manufacturers stood at minus   four, an improvement from minus nine in May. It had been expected to be   minus-three for August. In the next survey, the Bank of Japan expects   the non-manufacturers index at minus-three.   By sector, a major bright spot was that the index of the leasing sector   turned positive, rising to plus-20 from minus-seven, the first time it   has been in positive territory since November 1990, the Bank of Japan   said. The leasing index was at its highest since February 1990, when it   stood at 27.   The Bank of Japan said the latest survey was based on manufacturer   assumptions that the dollar-yen exchange rate in the year to March 1997   would average 102.23 yen, compared with 101.39 in the May survey.   Analysts said the survey confirmed that Japan\\'s economic recovery   remained sluggish and indicated interest rates were unlikely to rise in   the foreseeable future.   \"My view is that the recovery is more sluggish than the consensus, with   a weak 1997 likely,\" said ING Baring Securities analyst Tod Wood.',\n",

Confirming the players will miss Sunday's one-day match in Auckland,   McDermott said recent times had been `the darkest weeks in the history   of the sport.''   McDermott said the ``woeful results'' recorded in recent times by New   Zealand had been caused by a ``general lack of self discipline and   application -- and we've had enough.''

The leading electronics maker said group sales for the period levelled   off at 2,213.9 billion yen.

But sales of heavy electrical apparatus dropped 23 percent to 464.4   billion yen due partly to restrained capital investment by the private   sector, it said.   Consumer electronics sales were up five percent at 697.1 billion yen.   The sector-by-sector sales included tradings within groups, and sales   of some products were counted in two or more segments.

       " 'training-0947': {'body': \"   Nintendo of America on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit accusing one   of its business partners of helping to produce hundreds of thousands of   counterfeit copies of Nintendo's hot-selling Donkey Kong Country video   game.   The civil suit against Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics, filed   in U.S. District Court here, contends Samsung illegally manufactured   the tiny microprocessor chips that contain the audio and video   information for the game cartridges. The chips were sold on the black   market to companies in the Far East and elsewhere where counterfeit   Nintendo games were mass-produced, the suit says.   The bogus cartridges often sell for about half the dlrs 59 retail price   of a real Donkey Kong Country game, costing Nintendo millions of   dollars in lost sales, said Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of   America, which is based in suburban Redmond.   The counterfeit games have shown up in Asia, Latin America, Europe and   the Middle East as well as the United States, Nintendo said.   The suit seeks immediate termination of illegal production, seizure of   all counterfeit games and monetary damages that Lincoln said would be   in the ``millions of millions of dollars.''   Samsung said it had no idea its chips were winding up in counterfeit   Nintendo games.   ``Nintendo's action is the equivalent of suing a diskette or computer   vendor because you found pirated software on one of their disks,''   Samsung Semiconductor, the San Jose, Calif.-based subsidiary of Samsung   Electronics, said in a statement released through its public-relations   firm.   U.S. companies such as Nintendo and software giant Microsoft Corp. have   long complained of pirated products that they say have cost them   billions of dollars in sales. Lost also are U.S. technology, jobs and   markets, they say.   Donkey Kong Country is the fastest-selling game ever produced by   Nintendo, the world's leading video-game manufacturer. Since it was   introduced late last year, about 6 million copies have been sold.   ``Counterfeiters always go for a kill on the most popular games.   Certainly, Donkey Kong Country is the most popular video game we've   ever produced on a worldwide basis,'' Lincoln said in a telephone   interview.   Lincoln said he and other Nintendo officials met with senior Samsung   executives in November in Redmond to spell out concerns over   counterfeiting involving older Nintendo video games. Nintendo wasn't   aware at that point that Samsung-produced chips were also going into   counterfeit copies of Donkey Kong Country, Lincoln said.   He said Samsung executives promised to stop the counterfeiting, but   didn't.   Nintendo found out about bogus Donkey Kong Country cartridges two weeks   ago, following tips from video-game distributors at the Consumer   Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Lincoln said. Nintendo has since gotten   hold of counterfeit copies of the games in different parts of the   world.   ``I find the whole thing almost incredible, that a company of this   alleged stature would be doing this. And yet, the fact of the matter is   we have proof that they are doing it,'' Lincoln said. ``How high the   knowledge of this goes is anyone's guess.''   Samsung denied it was knowingly manufacturing chips for use in   counterfeit Nintendo games.   ``Their action is all the more disappointing because Samsung has for   some time aggressively sought to identify and disengage from any   customers engaged in illegitimate business practices,'' Samsung said.   In fact, Samsung said, it stopped doing business with one customer as a   result of an investigation prompted by Nintendo concerns.   Nintendo has had a longstanding business relationship with Samsung, the   world's largest computer memory-chip maker. The Korean conglomerate   produces specialized components used in Nintendo video games, including   the 32-bit microprocessor chips used in Donkey Kong Country.   Lincoln said Nintendo's business relationship with Samsung ``will be   reviewed.'' He stopped short of saying whether Nintendo will sever ties   with Samsung, one of its major suppliers.\",\n",

A 15 kilometer (nine-mile) convoy of 220 jeeps, trucks and other   vehicles carrying 308 peacekeepers crossed into Serbia at 2 p.m. (1200   GMT). Serbian police said all the Dutch peacekeepers had left   Srebrenica.   By early evening, about 170 vehicles headed down the main highway out   of Serbia toward U.N. headquarters at Zagreb, Croatia. Twenty-one   trucks, each carrying an armored personnel carrier, headed toward   Dobanovci, a town some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Belgrade,   where there is a large U.N. warehouse.   The Dutch also took 26 Bosnian personnel with them, for fear they would   be harmed if they were left behind, Voorhoeve said.   The peacekeepers were kept largely confined in their compound at   Potocari, just north of Srebrenica town, when thousands of terrified   Muslims fled there as the rebel Serbs swept into the enclave July 11.   By July 12, Bosnian Serb commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, and his troops   arrived at Potocari and began busing thousands of Muslim women,   children and old men out towards Bosnian government lines.   Some 15,000 Srebrenica men set off through the woods to reach   government territory. Around 4,000 made it, but there is no word on the   fate of the 11,000 others, or of men and young women taken away by the   Serbs from Potocari.   Seventy-five Dutch peacekeepers, 55 of them detained by the Serbs   before and during the capture of Srebrenica, arrived in the Netherlands   last Monday hinting they had seen ``horrible'' episodes, but afraid to   tell more because of their comrades still in the town.   ``Of course, in the last several days, we felt that our freedom of   speech was constrained by the fact that there were so many Dutch   military still in the hands of the Bosnian Serb military,'' Voorhoeve   admitted in London.   ``Fortunately, they are free now, and our freedom of speech is   restored,'' he said.   Voorhoeve said the soldiers would be interviewed as to exactly what   happened in Srebrenica. Refugees have arrived in government-held Bosnia   with horrendous tales of rape, murder and other atrocities.   ``We do not have a complete picture, but we know enough tto say that   terrible things happened,'' Voorhoeve said.   ``There are serious indications that many people were killed, and that   thousands of men were taken away, first of all to a large soccer   field,'' he said, adding that thousands are missing.\",\n",

Including container terminals, mid-stream and river trade, it handled   14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 1997.   About 90 percent, by weight, of Hong Kong's external trade is handled   by the port, according to Hong Kong's Port Development Board (POB),   which forecasts that, with the economic and trade development of Hong   Kong and the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has to cope with a steady   growth of container cargo well into the 21st century.   A new container terminal, Container Terminal 9, is expected to be   completed in the early 2000s, which will expand substantially the   handling capacity of the existing eight container terminals at the Kwai   Chung/Stonecutters Island Container Port.   Meanwhile, work continued on both the new River Trade Terminal at Tuen   Men and the Permanent Mid-stream Facility at Stonecutters Island. Both   facilities are due to come into operation this year.   The throughput of the Hong Kong container port is forecast to grow on   an annual average of 5.8 percent in the next 10 years to 24 million   TEUs in 2006, and Hong Kong will retain its role as the major container   port for import and export to the Chinese mainland, according to the   latest findings of the Hong Kong Port Cargo Forecasts commissioned by   POB.   On the other hand, Hong Kong remains a prominent center for   ship-owning, ship-financing and ship-management. Latest figures from   the Hong Kong Shipping Register showed that a total fleet of 486   vessels, amounting to 6.13 million gross registered tons (GRT), were   registered under Hong Kong flag.   Hong Kong also stands as the hub of international and regional   aviation, with the status certainly to be enhanced by the forthcoming   opening of the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok.   Having served Hong Kong for several decades, the existing Kai Tak   airport has been lauded as one of the safest and most efficient   airports in the world. In the financial year ending March 31, 1997, the   passenger throughput at Kai Tak grew by 7.5 percent to over 30 million   while air cargo throughput jumped by 9.8 percent to over 1.6 million   tons.   In 1996, Kai Tak overtook Tokyo Narita to become the world's busiest   airport in terms of international cargo. In respect of international   passengers, it remained the third busiest after London Heathrow and   Frankfurt.   To accommodate continued robust growth in air traffic, the   20-billion-U.S. dollar Airport Core Program was started in the early   1990s. The world-class infrastructure project consists of 10 projects:   the new airport, the airport railway, roads, bridges and tunnels and   even a new town.   Upon opening on July 6, with the first of the two runways in operation,   the new airport is able to handle 35 million passengers and up to 3   million tons of air cargo annually.\",\n",

One will be disqualified as a candidate if he obtains an extract of a   register and use it for a purpose other than those related to the   election or imparts its contents to another person or fails to furnish   information in response to a requirement within the specified period.   The regulation will be tabled at the Provisional Legislative Council   (PLC) for negative vetting on November 5 and come into effect on the   same day if approved.   Woo said this is to enable elector registration to start immediately on   the same day so that eligible persons may have more time to register.   He said the registration period will last until January 16, 1998, and   he urged the public to register as electors and vote in the legislative   election.   Under the Basic Law, all permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special   Administrative Region (SAR) of China, who have reached the age of 18,   have the right to vote and the right to stand for election.   Meanwhile, the EAC today submitted to SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa   a report on its final recommendation on the delineation of geographical   constituency boundaries for the Legislative Council election.   The final recommendations have been drawn up after taking into   consideration all views expressed by the public on the EAC\\'s   provisional recommendations during a two-week public consultation   between October 11 and 24.   \"The decision of the chief executive will be gazetted in the form of an   order, which will be tabled in the PLC. A copy of the EAC\\'s report will   also be tabled in the PLC in accordance with the law,\" a government   spokesman said.   He added that the Financial Committee today approved a supplementary   provision of 167.52 million HK dollars (23.93 million U.S. dollars) to   cover expenditure on various preparatory work for the legislative   election, which includes voter registration and related tasks for the   compilation of the electoral roll.   The overall financial requirement for the election is about 500 million   HK dollars (64.1 million U.S. dollars), the spokesman said.',\n",

The policy-making central council is to meet on Thursday, and analyst   Jeorg Henzler at Industrial Bank of Japan commented that \"We had been   thinking that the Bundesbank would reduce its key interest rates (the   discount rate and the Lombard rate) at the end of September or in early   October. But the July dip in M3 opens up a completely new prospect\".   M3, the Bundesbank\\'s mid-term inflation indicator, unexpectedly fell in   July at an annualized 0.4 percent rate on provisional figures, after a   0.4 percent rise in June on final figures. The decline surprised most   analysts, who had expected an annualized rise of 0.7 to 1.2 percent.   The central bank relies mainly on M3 and the consumer price index in   deciding on monetary policy.   Henzler said conditions were now \"definitely better\" for those hoping   for a cut in the Bundesbank\\'s key rates, and such a move at the central   council meeting on Thursday is not impossible.   The discount rate has been 4 percent since March, and the Lombard 6   percent since May 13 last year.   Holger Fahringkrug, an analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said the   decline of M3 on an annual basis in July clearly shows that growth is   slowing in Germany, as was already shown by the drop in incoming orders   to industry (off 3.5 percent in June from May, seasonally adjusted)   announced by the Economics Ministry on Monday.   \"This cocktail of data has definitely improved chances of monetary   loosening, and the rate drop could even occur this week\", said   Fahringkrug.   The absence of inflation risks in Germany is another argument for   lowering rates, he continued. \"Wholesale prices fell by 0.7 percent in   July from June, and industrial production prices by 0.1 percent in July   from June, showing that there are good chances the rise in consumer   prices in western Germany will approach the forecast the Bundesbank   made for 1995, which is 2 percent\".   Analyst Peter Pietsch at Commerzbank thinks the Bundesbank will not   reduce its key rates on Thursday, but the securities repurchase   (\"repo\") rate might be cut again on Wednesday this week.   All analysts queried shared this view, and many of them think the   marginal repo rate could go as low as 4.15 percent in the coming weeks.   On August 2, it fell to its present 4.45 percent against 4.50 percent   at the start of June.   The repo rate enables the central bank to fine-tune monetary policy. It   is the rate at which the central bank acquires commercial paper from   the commercial banks for periods ranging from a few days to two months,   in exchange for allocating funds to the banks.   Pietsch thinks the Bundesbank will wait for release on September 6 of   six-month GDP data for Germany before lowering the discount and Lombard   rates.   The bank will also naturally keep an eye on exchange rates, especially   on the level of the dollar, which firmed last week against the mark and   the yen in the wake of large-scale intervention by the US Federal   Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank.   Analyst John Lipsky at Salomon Brothers commented that confirmation of   the dollar\\'s new firmness would make a Bundesbank rate cut \"less   necessary. A further modest cut in the repo rate remains likely, and   would be enough to make the Bundesbank happy\", he said.   Without being so categorical as Lipsky, Henzler also said the   Bundesbank would take time to observe the dollar\\'s trend before   lowering its key rates.',\n",

Farmers in central\\'s Greece great plain of Thessaly, who have blockaded   the country\\'s roads for three weeks promised to descend on the capital   Thursday \"with our wives and children\" to protest outside the   parliament building.   Their colleagues in Aigio in northern Greece, who are blocking the   Patras-Corinth motorway, said they would also join the Athens march,   which is to be staged to protest Greek belt-tightening measures which   will enable it to join the European economic and monetary union.   Minor incidents occurred in the region overnight as several angry lorry   drivers tried to force their way through the barricades.   Seamen meanwhile, who are protesting over proposals to erase tax breaks   in the draft 1997 budget, decided on a two-day extension of the action   they began on Monday in action which Greek Shipping Minister Stavros   Soumakis described as \"unacceptable.\"   \"The strikers\\' tactic of blocking all vessels, even those flying   foreign flags, serves neither their own interests nor those of the   Greek merchant navy,\" Soumakis said.   On Wednesday, the Maltese-registered \"Brindisi,\" and the \"Ionian Star\"   flying the Italian flag, were prevented from docking for several hours   at the western port of Igoumenitsa. Both vessels are owned by Greek   companies.   Three seamen were arrested at the port following clashes between the   strikers and the police.   The Greek government has been battling for three weeks against the kind   of industrial and social protest which is becoming increasingly   widespread across Europe, as member states pursue financial rigour in a   bid to tailor their economies to the demands of monetary union.   Farmers, seamen and public sector workers have protested bitterly   against the Socialist government\\'s tough austerity budget, the most   stringent for 15 years, designed to rein in Greek public finances to   prepare the country for the single currency by 2000 or 2001.   Parliament, where the socialists have a comfortable majority, is to   vote Saturday on the austerity budget.   The farmers, who represent 20 percent of the Greek work force, have   demanded talks with Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who has said he is   prepared to hold \"open dialogue\" with the farmers, but only on   condition that the barricades be lifted.   On Wednesday, Greek Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas held out   an olive branch to the farmers by promising that they would get 10   billion drachmas (41 million dollars) from EU coffers as compensation   for producers hit by adverse weather and new regulations on cotton,   Greece\\'s main crop.   \"The (European) commission wants to help Greece,\" Tzoumakas said after   returning from talks with European Agriculture Commissioner Franz   Fischler in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU council of ministers   Monday and Tuesday.   In some parts of Greece, the strike movement continued to wind down   Wednesday, with most of the remaining roadblocks being removed.   But the seamen continued to hold firm, prompting incidents Wednesday   morning, in which lorry drivers tried to drive their trucks onto a   ferry in the port of Piraeus near Athens.   Some 600 lorries have been blocked in Piraeus, and dozens more in   Salonika. Pickets Tuesday prevented cruise ships from docking in Patras   and on the island of Corfu.   The stoppage has hit sailings all the country\\'s other ports, including   those on the Greek islands.',\n",

       " 'training-1836': {'body': \"   In a move intended to appease his predecessor, Italy's new prime   minister, Lamberto Dini, said Wednesday that he and his Cabinet of   ``technicians'' would stay in office long enough to enact its program,   and then make way for a newly elected government.   The outgoing prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said Tuesday that he   would not support Dini's new government in parliament unless he was   assured that it would lead to new elections soon.   Wednesday, Berlusconi said he wanted a public commitment not only from   Dini but also from President Oscar Luigi Scalfero, who he said had   promised a mid-June election date in private conversations last week.   In a statement read at his first news conference, Dini said his   government has a ``duty to carry out its unavoidable emergency task   until the political forces freely chosen by the voters are able to form   a government which is more representative of popular sovereignty.''   Dini, who had been treasury minister in the outgoing government,   avoided mentioning any date, noting that only Scalfero has the   constitutional authority to call an election. But he said he would hand   in his mandate as soon as his government accomplished its objectives,   which he said could be a matter of ``a few months.''   The new prime minister, a former general director of the Bank of Italy   who kept the job of treasury minister for himself, said he was keenly   aware of the ``restlessness on national and international markets,'' as   a result of Italy's political crisis.   Thus, he said, there is an urgent need for ``an effective government of   action which must be carried out with full responsibility, and thus   with the loyal support of the widest possible parliamentary majority.''   Members of parliament said Wednesday that the debate on the new   government will begin early next week, with a confidence vote in the   Chamber of Deputies likely to come as early as Wednesday. The new   government has 10 days from the date of its appointment to win approval   from both houses of parliament.   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)   Without the support of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, however, Dini   will have a hard time getting his program of economic and electoral   reforms passed.   At an earlier news conference, Berlusconi said he would not be   satisfied with promises made by the new prime minister alone. ``It is   not enough to say that once the program has been carried out, the   government will quit,'' Berlusconi said. ``There must be two public   affirmations. A promise must be made to the Italian people.''   Dini conferred Wednesday night with Scalfero, but no new statement was   expected. Scalfero has been sharply attacked in the last two days by   Berlusconi's allies, who have accused the president of luring the   former prime minister into a trap that left him with no representation   in the new government and no formal commitment that Dini's role would   be transitional only.   The clash has turned on the question of new elections, which the   Berlusconi faction thought was an understood, although not public, part   of the deal leading to Dini's appointment as prime minister last week.   From the day he resigned Dec. 22, Berlusconi has insisted either on his   own reappointment as prime minister, or on new elections.   ``To put off elections would be running away from reality, from   responsibility, from the possibility of putting through reforms,''   Berlusconi said again Wednesday.   Scalfero has said that he has so far not found a clear will in   parliament for a return to the ballot box so soon after last March's   vote.\",\n",

The   intervention\\'s primary objective will be to communicate to Russia,   through kind but firm military means, how much it means to the European   community, how its problems have been affecting its neighbors, and what   its allies want their relationship to be like in the future.   \"I really don\\'t think Russia understands how much it hurts my country   when it does some of the things it does,\" Polish president Aleksander   Kwasniewski said. \"It withholds not only affection and attention, but   vast oil and mineral reserves. There was a time when Russia was there   for us with foreign aid. We could turn to them for emotional and   military support. No more.\"   \"I\\'m not surprised, though,\" Kwasniewski continued. \"I mean, these last   few years, Russia\\'s been letting itself go to hell internally-roads,   bridges, the power grid, you name it. How can you take care of others   when you can\\'t even take care of yourself?\"   Much of the frustration felt by Russia\\'s allies stems from the nation\\'s   inability to be self-reliant despite its age, its incredible potential,   and the tremendous amount of help it has received over the years.   \"I\\'ve given Russia something like $8.5 billion in foreign aid and   international-relief loans since 1995,\" President Clinton said. \"And   what do they do when they get all that money? They devalue the ruble,   close up the banks, and then turn around and ask Germany for a few   billion more. Where does it all go?\"   \"Let\\'s just say I have my suspicions,\" added Clinton, making a drinking   motion with his hand.   \"Funny how Russia always manages to scrounge up a few bucks when they   want to roll into Chechnya and raise a little hell,\" French president   Jacques Chirac said. \"Well, I\\'m not helping them pay for that stuff   anymore. And if I have to get together with the boys and go over there   myself to put a stop to it, I will.\"   Organizers of the military intervention say they expect Russia to put   up resistance when massed troops appear on its doorstep. They are   confident, however, that Russia will eventually come to realize that   the intervention is for its own good.   \"I can already hear what Russia\\'s going to say,\" Schr\\xf6der said. \"It\\'s   going to be like, \\'Hey, I\\'m making strides.

This was the first annual contraction of the country's real gross   domestic product (GDP) after 12 years of uninterrupted expansion   averaging 7.8 percent per annum. Even in 1997 when the regional   financial crisis erupted, real GDP grew by 7.7 percent.   Per capita income in nominal terms declined to 11,835 ringgit (about   3,018 U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 12,051 ringgit (about 4,284 U.S.   dollars) in 1997, according to the report.   In 1998, activities in all sectors were affected with the exception of   the mining sector.   Output of the manufacturing sector contracted by 10.2 percent in 1998,   the first decline since 1985, with output of the domestic-oriented   industries falling sharply by 13.4 percent owing to the severe   contraction in domestic demand, and that of export-oriented industries   by 7.3 percent reflecting the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific   region which accounted for 40 percent of Malaysia's manufactured   exports.   The construction sector in the year under review experienced a most   severe contraction in output by 24.5 percent against a growth of 9.5   percent in 1997.   The sharp contraction in this sector was attributed to completion of   large projects, deferment of selected new infrastructure projects and   slow implementation of existing infrastructure projects as well as   postponement of non-residential projects.   The agriculture sector contracted by 4 percent in 1998, reflecting   declines in the production of all major commodities such as crude palm   oil and rubber affected mainly by adverse weather, labor shortage,   unfavorable prices, reduced cultivated area and lower yields.   However, value added in the mining sector increased further by 0.8   percent in 1998 against 1 percent growth in 1997, reflecting primarily   higher production of crude oil and gas increasing by 1.7 percent and   0.3 percent respectively, and a turnaround in tin production which grew   by 10.8 percent.   Following the contraction in the economy, the growth in the service   sector moderated in 1998, which recorded a growth rate of 1.5 percent   compared with 8 percent in 1997.   On the demand side, aggregate domestic demand declined, for the first   time since 1986, by 20.6 percent in current prices in 1998 against a   growth of 9.6 percent in 1997 and an average annual growth rate of   about 13.5 in the period 1987-97.   Total consumption spending declined by 6.5 percent in nominal terms in   1998 following an increase of 8 percent in 1997.   The contraction in total investment was significantly higher at 39   percent in nominal terms and 44.9 percent in real terms with private   investment declining by 53.3 percent in nominal terms.   In 1998, gross national savings continued to increase by 5.1 percent in   1998 despite the contraction in the domestic economy, thus bringing its   share in gross national product (GNP) to 41.2 percent against 39.4   percent recorded in 1997.   The balance of payments outturn in 1998 was much better than expected   with the current account recording an unprecedented large surplus of   36.1 billion ringgit (about 9.2 billion U.S. dollars), far exceeding   the 20.1 billion ringgit (about 5.29 billion U.S. dollars) surplus   projected in the 1999 budget announcement in October 1998.   Malaysia's overall external debt situation improved in 1998. The   country's total external debt outstanding declined by 6.4 percent to   159.8 billion ringgit (about 42 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of   1998 and short-term debt accounted for only 18 percent of the total   external debt against 25 percent in 1997.   In 1998, the gross international reserves held by the central bank rose   significantly by about 68 percent to 99.438 billion ringgit (about 26.2   billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1998, a level sufficient to finance   5.7 months of retained imports.   In the year under review, the inflation rate increased by 5.3 percent,   but lower than the earlier estimates of 7 - 8 percent.   On the employment front, in the face of a contraction in domestic   economic activity, the unemployment rate is estimated to have increased   from 2.5 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 1998, below the full   employment level of 4 percent.   In 1998, Malaysia's macroeconomic policy management focused on reducing   risks in the economy to ensure macroeconomic stability and promote a   stronger financial system.   The annual report said that overall, there are indications that the   trough in the growth cycle had been reached in the third quarter of   1998 and Malaysia ended the year on a positive note, with the   underlying economic conditions generally favorable.   Malaysia is expected to stage a recovery in 1999 with real GDP   recording a positive growth of 1 percent.\",\n",

The shuttle, with U.S. astronauts Kenneth Cameron, James Halsell, Jerry   Ross and William McArthur and Canadian Chris Hadfield on board, will   land on November 20, said the sources at the center located in Moscow.   Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and astronaut of the   European Space Agency Thomas Reiter will continue work aboard the Mir   till February 1996.

       " 'training-1944': {'body': '   The Kenyan government has taken stringent measures to protect local   industries from unfair competition arising from transit goods illegally   diverted into the domestic market.   Under the measures, all goods in transit shall be stored in special   godowns licensed by Kenyan Commissioner of Customs and Excise.   The transit godowns should be clearly marked in large letters and the   serial number given by the Commissioner and they should not be used for   storage of any other goods.   On sugar imports, licensed transit godowns should be required to   construct a separate part inside for the storage of sugar only.   All existing conditions governing the movement and control of goods in   transit should be fulfilled and during the 45-day period such goods   must be re-exported from Kenya.   Goods in transit stored in unlicensed godowns will be liable to   forfeiture and owners of unlicensed godowns will be guilty of an   offense.   It is believed that all these measures are mainly aimed at protecting   domestic sugar producers and ensuring that the government collects its   rightful revenue.   Earlier this month, the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) appealed to   the government to protect local sugar companies from unscrupulous   importers.   Local companies are now having 70,000 tons of sugar in store, which are   unable to sell due to the flooding of Kenyan market by imported sugar   at cheaper prices.   Sugar industry sources asserted that imported sugar meant for   neighboring countries is being diverted to the local markets at low   prices because no duties have been paid.   Last year most of more-than-400-million-U.S.-Dollar sugar imported for   transit to other countries were dumped on local markets in the eastern   African country.   The FKE noted that \"it is against the principles of liberalization of   the market and globalization of trade as importation of cheap sugar   does not provide a level-playing ground or promote fair competition in   the local market.\"   According to Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi, the   transportation of the imported sugar meant for Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi   and Zaire is being closely monitored to ensure it is not sold to   consumers locally.',\n",

       " 'training-1946': {'body': '   Burundi\\'s government on Monday declared a period of mourning for a   cabinet minister whose murder at the weekend raised fears of a new   ethnic bloodbath between the central African country\\'s Hutus and   Tutsis.   Communications Minister Germain Nkeshimana said the mourning for Energy   and Mines Minister Ernest Kabushemeye, a member of the Hutu majority,   will last until Thursday, when he is due to be buried.   One of the attackers died in hospital of his wounds on Saturday after   being shot by one of the minister\\'s bodyguards, and an injured   bodyguard also died on Sunday, national radio reported Monday.   Police on Sunday said they had arrested two suspects over the unclaimed   attack on Kabushemeye, who was shot dead Saturday as he was driving his   car in the centre of the capital Bujumbura. At least one passer-by was   hurt.   On Monday, no further information was released on the arrests, which   were confirmed by President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, or on the   identities of the assailants.   The Burundian government is a coalition linking parties of the Tutsi   minority with moderate Hutu parties under an agreement reached last   year to stave off mass ethnic bloodshed in the traditionally unstable   highland nation.   In October 1993, more than 50,000 people died in massacres sparked by   the assassination in a failed military coup bid of the first Hutu   president, Melchior Ndadaye, elected in Burundi\\'s first multiparty   elections that year.   Tutsis form the ethnic minority in Burundi, but dominate the armed   forces and have in the past bloodily put down Hutu risings.   Nkeshimana declared in a statement that during the mourning period,   radio and television would replace variety shows with broadcasts of   religious and classical music and flags would fly at half-mast, but he   asked the population to go about its business as usual.   The capital was calm overnight Sunday, but shooting and explosions had   been heard late Saturday in the working-class districts of Nyakabiga,   Bwiza, and Jabe, national radio reported.   However, businesses were closed in the central province of Muramvya,   however, after gunmen opened fire from a vehicle before fleeing. Nobody   was hurt, but tension was high, residents reached by telephone said.   Burundian radio said that political parties across the board condemned   the assassination of Kabushemeye, who headed Burundian People\\'s Rally,   a small party allied to the president\\'s mainly Hutu Front for Democracy   in Burundi (FRODEBU).   Last April, crisis struck when Ndadaye\\'s successor Cyprien Ntaryamira   died with Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious plane   crash which sparked a bloodbath between Hutus and Tutsis in the   neighbouring country.   Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, was named to office late last year following   negotiations between the political parties, which agreed that the   situation in the country was too tense for a vote to take place.   The president, in Copenhagen for the UN summit on poverty, warned he   might have to break off his democratisation programme and take   \"necessary measures to restore order\" if ethnic violence continued in   the country.   He told AFP Kabushemeye\\'s murder would provoke \"insecurity and   destablisation\" but said he did not believe the killing would spark   civil war.   The assassinated minister was the brother-in-law of the bishop of   Bujumbura \"whose family was exterminated and who himself survived an   attack three weeks ago,\" said the president, who is also a Hutu.   Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo held an emergency cabinet meeting on   Sunday and said an investigation had been ordered into the murder,   whose findings would be made public.',\n",

Slovenia\\'s state electoral commission said 89.61% voted in favour of   joining the EU, 66.02% supported Nato membership, and 96% voted against   returning the citizenship rights stripped of its 18,000 Bosnian, Croat,   and Serb inhabitants. After Slovenian officals declared independence   from Yugoslavia in 1992, ensuring automatic promotion within the new   state apparatus, the ethnic minority inhabitants, now known as \\'The   Erased\\',   were obliged to re-apply for citizenship. Amid independence   celebrations, however, authorities neglected to inform them of their   change in status.   \"It is a shame that they were erased, but the country will go bankrupt   if it has to pay compensation,\" said Miha Sentjak, a bus driver. \"We\\'ve   come too far to let the country go down the drain just like that.\"   \"I welcome the vote of confidence Slovenes have given Nato and their   willingness to accept the obligations of membership,\" Nato Secretary   General George Robertson said in a statement. He added that NATO member   Turkey has never acknowledged the Armenian genocide of 1915-1923, that   in 1999 Germany was able to project genocidal guilt onto Serbia and   assist in its destruction, and that the Slovenian conscience will soon   be mollified through membership of NATO\\'s forthcoming but undisclosed   humanitarian intervention.   Following the decline in support for multiculturalism in US and UK   populations, Slovenian voters have gone beyond Anglo-Saxon \\'enlightened   mono-culturalism\\' to reclaim the ideal of a mono-ethnic state as   favoured by fellow NATO member Croatia and fellow ex-Yugoslavia member   Kosovo.   \"Future generations will tell us whether the decision we made was the   right one,\" said the daily Dnevnik.   The current US-led attack on Iraq, however, is opposed by 80% of   Slovenes and some fear membership of Nato will mean domination by an   ethnically mixed US. Slovenes are said to hold a \\'common-sense\\'   approach to the Iraqi question, favouring division into Kurdistan and   Shia and Sunni entities.   The Austria-Hungary Institute, a Llubjana based think-tank, has led a   delegation to Washington and advised Congressmen to follow the   Slovenian model in its occupation of Iraq. Iraqis should be obliged to   re-register as citizens, and when they fail to do so due to unfortunate   administrative errors, they will be deprived of rights relative to the   ethnic American minority. A pro-American government, made up of ethnic   Americans, will then legitimise the Iraqi Governing Council.   Pentagon officials have made no comment on the Slovenian proposal,   having pumped tens of millions of dollars into the Serb run Operation   Containment, which leading Democrats are already critisizing as \\'too   soft\\'.   \"Why don\\'t these Serbs just let our brave men and women do their jobs?\"   said Presidential Candidate John Kerry, showing the first signs of a   Republican/Democrat split over \\'dovish\\' Serb and \\'hawkish\\' Slovenian   military advisers. The Bush camp has hit back, claiming that pausing   around Fallujah to allow evacuation of women and children ultimately   meant a higher liquidation ratio of Iraqi men.   In Slovenia itself the popular victory of \\'Slovenia for the Slovenes\\'   has inspired a number one pop song:   \"We can say that our generation is a brave generation, perhaps even a   little bit adventurous.\"',\n",

As the presidential aircraft touched down at Stuttgart airport in   southwest Germany on Wednesday, Dyachenko, 37, crept out from the back   of the plane, leaving her parents to shake hands with the row of   officials lined up on the red carpet.   On Thursday, the official programme said that Dyachenko, who was one of   the major forces in Yeltsin\\'s re-election campaign last year, would   spend the day with her mother Naina, visiting castles in the Black   Forest near Baden-Baden.   However, her press spokeswoman Natalya Konstantinovna, said later that   she had decided to instead spend the day walking alone in the   pedestrianised centre of this spa town.   As Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave a joint press conference,   the pack of press photographers who sought to photograph Dyachenko   searched in vain.   Dressed in a black trouser suit and easily recognisable, with her short   haircut and full figure, Tatyana Dyachenko hid herself at the back of   the room and as soon as Kohl said there would be only one more   question, she slipped away.   Only at the evening ceremony during which Yeltsin was presented with   the prestigious German media prize did his daughter allow herself   briefly to be filmed by the cameras.   Konstantinovna explained that the award was the only reason for which   she took part in the trip, saying: \"She wanted to be there to welcome   the recognition given her father on this occasion.\"   Such a stance is unlikely to quell the rumours of Kremlin intrigue   which have swirled around the mother of two and former space engineer.   Dyachenko has no official title, but the Kremlin hinted in December   that she could well have one soon or later.   However, the discretion which has characterised the Baden-Baden visit   could mean that the Kremlin has abandoned the idea.

       " 'training-0565': {'body': '   The controversial decision, the first of its kind in the 210-year   history of U.S. representative government, was, according to Justice   David Souter, \"a response to the clear, demonstrable incompetence and   indifference of the current U.S. citizenry in matters concerning the   operation of this nation\\'s government.\"   As a result of the ruling, the American people will no longer retain   the power to choose their own federal, state and local officials or   vote on matters of concern to the public.   \"This decision was by no means easy, but it unfortunately had to be   done,\" said Justice Antonin Scalia, who penned the majority decision in   the case. \"The U.S. Constitution is very clear: In the event that the   voting public becomes incapacitated or otherwise unfit to carry out its   duties of self-governance, there is a danger posed to the republic, and   the judicial branch is empowered to remove said public and replace it   with a populace more qualified to lead.\"   \"In light of their unmitigated apathy toward issues of import to the   nation\\'s welfare and their inability to grasp even the most basic   principles upon which participatory democracy is built, we found no   choice but to rule the American people unfit to govern at this time,\"   Scalia concluded.   The controversial ruling, court members stressed, is not intended as a   slight against the character of the American people, but merely a   necessary measure for the public good.   \"The public\\'s right to the best possible representation is a founding   principle of our nation,\" Justice Sandra Day O\\'Connor told reporters.   \"If you were on a jet airliner, you wouldn\\'t want an untrained,   incompetent pilot at the controls, and this is the same thing. As   federal justices, we have taken a solemn oath to uphold every citizen\\'s   constitutional rights, and if we were to permit an irresponsible,   disinterested public to continue to helm the ship of state, we would be   remiss in our duties and putting the entire nation at risk.\"   The ruling brings to an end a grueling 10-month process, during which   more than 100 Supreme Court hearings were held to determine the   public\\'s capacity for self-governance. Despite the fact that these   hearings were aired on C-SPAN, a majority of U.S. citizens were unaware   of them because coverage was largely eclipsed by the Clinton-Lewinsky   scandal, the retirement of NBA legend Michael Jordan, and the release   of Titanic on home video.   The Supreme Court found that, though 78 percent of U.S. citizens have   seen the much-anticipated Star Wars prequel trailer, only one in   200,000 were aware that the multibillion-dollar \"Star Wars\"   missile-defense system had been approved by Congress. Additionally,   while 62 percent of citizens correctly identified the cast of Suddenly   Susan, only .01 percent were able to identify Attorney General Janet   Reno beyond \"some woman Jay Leno always says looks like a man.\"   Further, only .0003 percent could correctly identify the ancient Greek   city-state of Athens as the birthplace of the concept of an educated   citizenry participating in democratic self-rule.   But the final straw, Supreme Court justices said, came last week when   none of the 500,000 random citizens polled were aware that Russian   President Boris Yeltsin had threatened global thermonuclear war in   response to NATO air attacks in Yugoslavia.   \"I mean, come on,\" Justice William Rehnquist said. \"Global   thermonuclear war? It\\'s just ridiculous. There was just no way we could   trust such a populace to keep running things after that.\"   Populations currently being considered to fill the leadership void   until the American people can be rehabilitated and returned to   self-governance include those of Switzerland, Sweden and Canada.   \"I\\'m willing to do what I can to help out in this time of crisis and   make sure that my vote counts,\" said Stockholm resident Per Johanssen.   \"I\\'ve been reading up on America a bit, just to get a general idea of   what needs to be done, and from what I can tell, they really need some   sort of broad-based health-care reform over there right away.\"   In a provisional test of the new system, the Canadian province of   Saskatchewan will hold primaries next Tuesday to re-evaluate last   fall\\'s gubernatorial election in Minnesota.   The lone dissenting vote came from Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, in his   minority opinion wrote, \"Although the American people are clearly   unable to make responsible decisions at this time, it is not their   fault that they are so uninformed. Rather, the blame lies with the   media interests and corporate powers that intentionally keep them in   the dark on crucial issues.\"   Kennedy concluded his opinion by tendering his immediate resignation   and announcing his intent \"to move to a small island somewhere.\"   Thus far, reaction to the ruling has been largely indifferent.   \"The people ruled unfit to govern? Yeah, I I think I might\\'ve heard   something about that,\" said Covington, KY, sales representative Neil   Chester. \"I think I saw it on the news or something, when I was   flipping past trying to find that show about the lady sheriff.\"   \"If you ask me, voting was a big pain anyway,\" agreed mother of four   Sally Heim of Augusta, ME. \"At least now I\\'m free to do my   soap-opera-trivia crossword puzzles in peace, without all that   distraction about who\\'s running for Second District Alderperson and   what-not.\"   Despite the enormous impact the ruling would seem to have, many   political experts are downplaying its significance.   \"It doesn\\'t really change anything, to be honest,\" said Duke University   political-science professor Benjamin St. James. \"The public hasn\\'t made   any real contributions to the governance of the country in decades, so   I don\\'t see how this ruling affects all that much.\"   \"I wouldn\\'t worry about it,\" St. James added. \"It\\'s not that   important.\"',\n",

A court of inquiry will look into the causes of the emergency landing   in an area of the island\\'s north riddled by guerrillas of the   separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), officials said.   Energy minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said he had a \"close shave\" after   the Bell 412 helicopter landed at a farm and he had to walk five   kilometres (three miles) to safety.   Ratwatte, who is also junior defence minister, said instruments in the   helicopter malfunctioned while it was flying to the town of Weli Oya in   the northeast and the pilot ditched when the aircraft ran out of fuel.   \"We had a close shave,\" Ratwatte told local reporters after reaching   Weli Oya, 300 kilometres (187 miles) northeast of here.   \"We landed in Tiger territory in the Wanni (jungles).\"   However, officials said they will also focus on other issues, such as   if the pilots were disoriented.   The Sri Lankan air force has a chequered flying record, losing seven   aircraft between April last year and January this year. A total of 280   passengers and crew were killed in the crashes, some of which were   blamed on Tiger attacks.   As Ratwatte and his entourage, which included army chief Rohan   Daluwatte, police Inspector-General W. B. Rajaguru and top military   field commander Asoka Jayewardene were rescued.   The military said Tiger rebels blew up the crippled helicopter.   \"We heard two explosions shortly after we started walking towards the   army defence lines,\" said a junior officer who accompanied the   minister.   Officials here earlier believed the army destroyed the helicopter to   prevent it from falling into the hands of the guerrillas, who are known   to possess micro-light aircraft but have not used them in attacks.   Vast areas of the island\\'s northern region are either controlled by the   LTTE or regarded as no-man\\'s land, where security forces nor rebels are   physically present.   \"We took all the precautions possible and used our intelligence to get   to safety,\" Ratwatte said.   \"We learnt many things.\"   A defence ministry statement said President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who   is also the defence minister, organised the rescue operations using   ground and air units of the security forces.   After the rescue, Ratwatte proceeded to his original destination to   open a school and a hospital in the remote district of Weli Oya.   Ratwatte is the key figure behind the government\\'s drive against the   LTTE which is fighting for independence in the island\\'s northern and   eastern regions.   As Ratwatte\\'s helicopter went missing, security authorities prepared   for a major search fearing that his aircraft may have crashed in   territory controlled by the Tamil Tiger rebels in the island\\'s north.   The separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas are known to have attacked   low-flying aircraft in the region, officials said.',\n",

In response to a request from Mozambique for help in training and   integrating government and former RENAMO rebel troops into one unified   army before the country\\'s first democratic elections, Zimbabwe has   agreed to send 14 officers and 105 soldiers to instruct.   \"The Mozambican government has requested the assistance of the Zimbabwe   defence forces in the training of 12 of the 15 battalions which are to   form the nucleus of the new national army,\" Zvinavashe told the   trainers who are expected to leave for Mozambique this week.

Just days ahead of the anniversary celebrations, Chief Executive Tung   Chee-hwa raised eyebrows in pro-democracy camps with the biggest   government shakeup since the 1997 handover of the British colony.   Tung, a shipping tycoon who begins a second five-year term on July 1   after being returned unopposed in March, unveiled a new ministerial   system in which political appointees ousted civil service bureaucrats.   Tung and his new cabinet are to be sworn in during handover   celebrations on Monday to be attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.   Although described by Tung as an \"accountability system,\" his new team   were approved by the communist authorities in Beijing and will be   accountable only to the chief executive.   Pro-democracy leaders here have voiced fears the changes will increase   the power of Tung, hand-picked by China five years ago and not very   popular in p8l territory, and allow him to surround himself with   unaccountable \"yes men.\"   The agreement returning Hong Kong to China called for the territory to   be governed by a \"one country, two systems\" arrangement under which it   would retain its capitalist lifestyle and considerable autonomy for 50   years.   Commenting on recent developments, Sonny Lo, a member of the research   group Hong Kong Transitional Affairs, quipped: \"It seems the aspect of   one country will dominate the`et&AMP;systems.\"   Joseph Cheng, a political commentator at City University, warned there   has been a gradual erosion of freedoms with Tung displaying \"less   tolerance to dissent and less tolerance to criticism from the   pro-democracy camp.\"   \"There is a danger of Tung becoming more authoritarian,\" he said.   Just this week, Hong Kong barred a Chinese-American rights activist,   Harry Wu, from visiting for the second time in less than three months.   No explanation for the move was forthcoming.   After Wu was denied entry in April the United States warned that Hong   Kong\\'s future hinged on free movement and free speech.   \"It is important to Hong Kong\\'s success as an international city that   it remain open to the travelling public and the use of denials of entry   could have the affect of limiting freedom of association and   restricting the flow of ideas,\" said US State Department deputy   spokesman Philip Reeker.   A number of members of the Falungong spiritual movement, banned by   Beijing as an \"evil cult\" but legal in Hong Kong, have also been denied   entry.   The threat of declining autonomy first surfaced three years ago when   the Tung government asked Beijing to reinterpret the Basic Law, the   territory\\'s mini-constitution, to overturn a ruling by Hong Kong\\'s   highest court that had granted residency to any mainlander with a Hong   Kong parent.   Another move which has sparked concern is discussion within the   government about drawing up a subversion law punishing offences against   the state.   On the issue of direct elections, a statement this week by a top   Chinese leader has dampened hopes of moving towards full democracy in   2007, when the Basic Law allows for a review of the electoral system.   Hong Kong\\'s chief executive is currently chosen by a Beijing-annointed   800-member Election Committe\\'(Bne-third of the seats in Hong Kong\\'s   60-seat Legislative Council are filled through elections with the   remainder chosen by business and professional groups and the committee.   Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who is responsible for Hong Kong   affairs, said the present system was effective and \"should be kept   intact.\"   \"Hong Kong is a commercial city and one of our country\\'s special   administrative regions,\" he told the local South China Morning Post.   \"This determines that it cannot copy the political system of anotem as   a blatant breach of the Basic Law.   \"Surely, it is up to the people of Hong Kong\" to decide if they want   direct elections after 2007, Lee said.

The latter is near coca-growing areas as well as the Switzerland-sized   enclave the Colombian government ceded to the 16,500-strong   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) during a three-year peace   process. When that process ended on February 20, soldiers who retook   the zone found two cocaine laboratories and 7.4 tonnes of cocaine.   Evidence of drug trafficking by Colombia's insurgents allowed officials   from US President George W. Bush's administration to direct military   aid to counter-insurgency efforts. It had previously been restricted by   Congress and by a previous presidential directive to the anti-narcotics   fight.   The United States has already earmarked 1.3 billion dollars largely for   use by the Colombian military. And Bush promised additional monies to   protect oil installations that are regularly attacked by the National   Liberation Army (ELN).   On Tuesday, Bush said that right-wing paramilitaries of the   10,000-strong United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) will be part   of the anti-insurgency fight.   AUC, like the FARC and the ELN, is on the US list of terrorist   organizations.\",\n",

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi made the remark at   a press conference in response to the U.S. administration\\'s lobbying   for a two-year extension of a law that punishes foreign firms having a   large investment in Iran\\'s oil industry.   \"We announce for the umpteenth time that in the status quo, any   restoration of ties between the two countries depends on fundamental   removal of barriers, including the U.S. sanctions against the Islamic   Republic of Iran,\" Asefi said.   Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after the   seizure, by some Muslim students, of the U.S. embassy in Tehran   following the 1979 Iran\\'s Islamic Revolution.   \"If the U.S. government is intent to take a positive stride in its   interaction with Iran, it should meet the legitimate demands without   any preconditions,\" the spokesman said.   \"Not only Iran slams the unilateral sanctions which contravene all   international laws and conventions, but also all the countries in the   world have practically opposed the act,\" he added.   Accusing Iran of sponsoring terrorism, seeking to sabotage Arab-   Israeli peace efforts and committing human rights abuses, the U.S. has   imposed economic sanctions against Iran since 1980.   Moreover, the U.S. adopted an act which punishes foreign firms having a   large energy investment in Iran and Libya five years ago to make the   sanctions more effective.   As the act is going to expire, a powerful pro-Israeli lobby is pressing   for another full five-year extension of the controversial legislation.   But the U.S. administration is in favor of a two-year extension.',\n",

       " 'training-2153': {'body': \"   United Arab Emirates (UAE) inhabitants are spending a record amount of   money on goods and services despite government austerity measures   prompted by low oil prices, an official report said Saturday.   Private consumption, which covers spending by individuals on consumer   goods and services, surged by 11.7 percent to a record 71.2 billion   dirhams (19.4 billion dollars) in 1994 from 63.7 billion dirhams (17.35   billion dollars) in 1993, according to the planning ministry report.   The report showed private consumption had steadily increased over the   past few years and the growth was faster than that of the population.   In contrast, government consumption rose by only 4.2 percent to 24.5   billion dirhams (6.67 billion dollars) in 1994 from 23.5 billion   dirhams (6.4 billion dollars) in 1993. Similar growth was recorded in   previous years.   The report expected final consumption, which includes government and   private consumption, to increase to 107 billion dirhams (29.1 billion   dollars) in 1995.   This will be coupled with a projected rise in imports to 85 billion   dirhams (23.1 billion dollars) from 80 billion dirhams (21.8 billion   dollars) in 1994.   The individual's share of final consumption stood as high as 11,700   dollars in 1994 and the share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at   around 16,500 dollars.   This indicates the country's nearly two million people spent an average   two thirds of their income on goods and services.   Bankers attributed the high spending to a sharp growth in construction,   trade, banking, insurance and other services sectors. They also cited   an expansion in the private sector as a result of government incentives   to boost its role in the domestic economy following the decline in   crude prices.   Such a decline has forced the UAE, a key OPEC producer, to slash   general expenditure over the past decade to tackle a persistent budget   deficit.   According to the report, total revenues plummeted to 39.1 billion   dirhams (10.65 billion dollars) in 1993 from 47.8 billion dirhams   (13.02 billion dollars) in 1991 while spending was slashed to 45.2   billion dirhams (12.31 billion dollars) from 56.8 billion dirhams   (15.47 billion dollars).   Despite the cut, the deficit persisted in 1993, standing at around 1.66   billion dollars.\",\n",

       " 'training-2150': {'body': '   As international investors gathered here Tuesday to discuss business   opportunities in Bangladesh, the finance minister begged the opposition   to call off its general strike and spare the economy.   The half-day strike against inflation was one in a lengthy series of   strikes the opposition has called in its efforts to bring about early   elections under a caretaker government.   Thousands of police and paramilitary officers guarded the streets and   cordonned off the Sonargaon Hotel, the venue of Euromoney International   Investors\\' Conference.   Tension was high on the road leading to the hotel from the residence of   Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was to drive through the strikers to   kick off the meeting.   Police escorted ministers and guests to the site of the conference, the   first ever to focus exclusively on Bangladesh.   Schools, shops and businesses were shut, and vehicles, except for   three-wheel pedicabs, stayed off the streets.   The opposition has come under fire from the business community for the   calling strikes for Tuesday and Wednesday, and Finance Minister Saifur   Rahman urged that the strike be halted to spare the economy.   However, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, Bangladesh\\'s main opposition leader,   defended Tuesday\\'s strike, saying it was a protest against the unusual   increase in the price of consumer goods ahead of the Moslem holy month   of Ramadan, which starts in February.   Ramadan is a month of daytime fasts that are usually followed by   after-dark feasts, and large quantities of food are generally consumed   during this period.   The nationwide general strike planned for Wednesday was to push the   opposition\\'s 10-month-old demand for elections under a neutral   caretaker government to ensure people\\'s voting rights, she said.   \"We are not against investment. We love this country,\" but development   should take place in a \"sound political system,\" she said.   Opposition MPs from Wajed\\'s Awami League, deposed president Hussain   Muhammad Ershad\\'s Jatiya Party and the Moslem fundamentalist   Jamaat-e-Islami party resigned from parliament December 28 after   boycotting it since March.

       " 'training-2156': {'body': \"   The U.S. dollar was slightly lower but steady against the Japanese yen   early Monday in Tokyo in a muted reaction to the breakdown of   U.S.-Japan auto talks over the weekend.   Traders said the mood on the market was quiet and tense in anticipation   of a U.S. announcement early this week of tough trade sanctions against   Japan, a step that would aggravate tensions between the two giant   economies and possibly shatter the dollar's recent stability.   Japan has said it would file a complaint with the World Trade   Organization, the recenlty formed trade arbiter, if Washington   publishes a sanctions list. President Clinton had promised strong   measures if the talks broke down.   Economists and traders fear that an escalation of trade frictions could   renew the dollar's plunge to record lows against the dollar, but for   now traders are waiting to see what happens next.   ``The market is waiting for the details of the sanctions,'' said   Chemical Bank trader Junichi Kodama. ``There is sentiment that the   dollar has already bottomed out, and some people are becoming bullish   on the dollar ... even though news is not good.''   ``Trading is likely to stay in a limited range until sanctions are   announced. After that, the dollar may be back on a downtrend,'' Kodama   said.   The dollar opened the week's trading at 83.58 yen on the Tokyo foreign   exchange market, down 0.18 yen from 83.76 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) last   Tuesday, before markets closed for a five-day holiday.   The Tokyo open was also down from 83.95 yen in late New York trading   Friday.   After hitting a global record low of 79.75 yen on April 19 in Tokyo,   the dollar has steadied itself in the low 80 yen range.   Many consider the dollar's persistent decline against the yen in recent   years to be the result of unprecedented growth in the U.S. trade   deficit with Japan, which reached a record dlrs 66 billion last year.   Autos and auto parts account for about 60 percent of the deficit.   Market players generally believe that Washington wants a strong yen as   a way to open Japanese markets to foreign products. Washington has   strengthened that association by emphasizing the link between the   course of the auto trade talks and the currency issue.   Japanese officials complain about what they view as Washington's   lukewarm stance in arresting the dollar's steady decline. So far this   year, the dollar's value has fallen about 16 percent against the yen.   In theory, a higher yen would trim Japan's trade surplus by forcing   Japanese exporters to raise prices, rendering them less competitive   abroad. But Japan's trade surplus has ballooned over the past few years   despite the persistent appreciation of the yen.   On the stock market, share prices rose slightly in thin trading   following an arbitrage-led rally last week. Traders said the fact that   the dollar did not plunge in early dealings was a positive factor for   the market.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 25.14 points, or 0.15 percent,   to 17,113.80 after the first half-hour of trading. The Nikkei rose   277.20 points, or 1.65 percent, on Tuesday before a five-day market   holiday.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section   was up 2.00 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,355.45. The TOPIX was up   21.47 points, or 1.61 percent, the previous trading day.   In early trading, the price of the benchmark No. 174 10-year Japanese   government bonds was 108.96 yen, up 0.46 yen from its close of 108.50   yen on Tuesday. The yield fell to 3.400 from 3.400.

       " 'training-2155': {'body': \"   Investigators probing a deadly subway bombing said Thursday they found   bits of a shattered blue gas canister and evidence pointed increasingly   to Algerian militants.   Meanwhile, police responded to more than 40 bomb alerts, and detained   hundreds of people in a nationwide manhunt, two days after the bombing   in Paris that took seven lives and injured more than 80.   ``France Under High Surveillance,'' read the headline of the   conservative daily Le Figaro. ``A Dirty War in Paris. But Which?''   headlined the center-left daily InfoMatin.   French radio station RTL, citing a police report, said a police   assistant saw two men he described as North African hurriedly leave a   large bag inside a train car, one station before the bomb went off.   RTL said the police assistant heard one of the men say, ``There's going   to be a party tonight at Saint-Michel.''   A leading investigator said he could not confirm the report, but told   The Associated Press that the evidence he has seen so far points to   Algerian Muslim extremists.   ``From all I hear and see, I think the fundamentalist lead is advancing   more than the others,'' said Prosecutor Francis Battut. ``It would be   the Armed Islamic Group.''   The extremist network has targeted officials as well as foreigners and   other civilians in Algeria in its battle to topple the military-backed   government and establish a state based on Islamic law.   France, as the former colonial ruler, maintains strong ties with the   Algiers government, which has angered the militants.   The Algerian newspaper La Tribune reported on July 17 that the Armed   Islamic Group had threatened to carry out ``bomb attacks in Paris to   punish the French government,'' according to Paris' Le Monde newspaper.   The group also has been linked to the hijacking of an Air France   jetliner in December. Police roundups before the bombing indicated the   militants were operating in Europe. They are suspected in the   assassination of a moderate Algerian cleric in Paris on July 11.   Authorities said they have received no credible claims of   responsibility for the blast at the Saint-Michel regional RER subway   station in the Latin Quarter of central Paris. It was the first deadly   bombing in Paris in nine years and shocked the city at the height of   the tourist season.   Two dozen people remained hospitalized, hospital officials said. Six of   the seven dead have been identified. All were French except for a   Portuguese woman who lived in a Paris suburb.   Police responded to at least 41 bomb alerts, caused by suspicious   packages or crank phone calls, by Thursday evening.   In Paris, the Lyon and Montparnasse train stations were evacuated after   abandoned packages were reported. A telephoned bomb threat briefly   disrupted Roissy Airport. About 1,500 people were evacuated from the   Louvre museum following a false alert.   No bombs were found, police said.   About 2,000 extra police were deployed nationwide to beef up security,   some called back from vacation, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman said,   requesting customary anonymity.   Law enforcement authorities ``have taken extremely strong precautions   in Paris and the provinces,'' Prime Minister Alain Juppe said.   In Paris, 250 more people were detained for identity checks in the 24   hours ending Thursday morning, and 200 other checks were made in   Marseille overnight Wednesday, police said.   Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre went on national TV on Wednesday   evening to ask the public for help to solve the crime. He gave a   special phone number for witnesses and offered a million-franc (dlrs   200,000) reward.   ``We're working like ants, talking to witnesses, examining the train   platforms and the cars,'' said Battut.   Battut confirmed that investigators found pieces of a blue gas   canister, the type commonly used by campers, in the wrecked train car.   Lab tests were being conducted to determine the kind of explosive it   contained, he said.   Besides Algerian extremists, the prosecutor has said other suspects   include Bosnian Serb militants; groups linked to the terrorist Carlos,   arrested by French authorities last August; or a deranged individual.   France has taken a tougher line against Serb fighters in the war in   Bosnia-Herzegovina, sending more troops in recent weeks to back up U.N.   peacekeepers.   Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said from Bosnia that ``any link   between Serbs and the bombing is ridiculous and out of the question.''   ``Serbs have no terrorist traditions,'' he said, according to the   Bosnian Serb Srna news agency. ``Despite differences with the French   government, Serbs love France.''   Paris was last hit by a wave of bombings in 1986 that left 13 dead,   claimed by an Iranian-backed Lebanese group.\",\n",

Gu Cheng, the 44-year-old farmer from Weihai in east China\\'s Shandong   Province, has, since 1988, set up China\\'s first nongovernmental   ecological design and researtch institute, first environmental   protection park, and first nongovernmental environmental protection   organization.   In the early 1980s, farmland in the village where Gu lived was taken   over for urban construction, so Gu shifted to the building industry and   soon struck it rich.   According to him, although he made quite a lot of money then, he often   felt lost because of the loss of the farmland. So, he began to   experiment with growing plants without soil on his balcony, regulating   the temperature using sunshine and the heat of a \"kang\" (a traditional   Chinese heated bed), and irrigating the plants with purified waste   water. As time went on, he became more and more interested in his work.   In 1988 he set up the first design and research institute of ecological   construction in China. In 1991, the institute began to experiment with   the construction of multi-story ecological buildings under the support   of the State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of   Construction. The purpose of the experiment was to increase the ability   to grow plants in multi-story structures. The area covered by the   multi-layer soilless beds is three times the basic outline of the   building. The results, which have won three patents, show that the   urban environment and utilization rate of soil resources can be greatly   improved, and water and ecological resources put to better use.   During the study and construction of ecological buildings, Gu contacted   many scholars and officials in the field of environmental protection   and his vision broadened, and his native feeling for farmland developed   into a greater affection for environmental protection.   In 1991 he raised 600,000 yuan and built an environmental protection   park with an area of about four ha. A nine-meter granite tower was   erected in the park, covered with pictures and messages calling   attention to environmental protection. Just before \"World Environment   Day\" in 1994, which fell on June 5, a stone tablet was erected in the   park, bearing the names of people who have made contributions to   environmental protection.   Gradually a group of environmental protectionists formed, with Gu as   their core, and in 1993, set up the Weihai Nongovernmental Green   Association. Gu was elected chairman.   The association has sponsored various activities dealing with   environmental protection, including holding exhibitions and seminars   and promoting environment-friendly products.   The association, with a membership of more than 4,000, led to the   founding of the Shandong Nongovernmental Green Association.   Weihai is one of China\\'s cleanest cities. At present, greater numbers   of citizens are becoming involved in environmental protection,   according to the city\\'s environmental protection officials.',\n",

The resolution stipulated that Baghdad must \"immediately complete the   withdrawal of all military forces recently deployed to southern Iraq to   their original positions.\"   It also said Iraq must not re-deploy such forces to the south \"or take   any other action to enhance its military capacity\" in the region, which   is near the Kuwaiti border.

His remarks and the UN Security Council resolution came at end of a   week-long standoff between Iraq and the west. The crisis was triggered   October 7 when Washington charged that Baghad had deployed 80,000   troops -- including its formidable Republican Guard -- near the Kuwaiti   border, reviving fears that it was about to re-invade the emirate it   overran in August 1990.

South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said at a cabinet   meeting in Cape Town on Wednesday that the cabinet had agreed to accept   a compromise with the EU to phase out the use of certain names in   spirit brands.   South Africa would phase out the terms of \"grappa\" and \"ouzo\", as well   as \"korn\", \"jagertee\" and \"pacharan\" over five years, he said.   \"Our hope is that we can now get down to the real business of the trade   agreement, and that we have now ended this bizarre dispute,\" Erwin was   quoted by South African Press Association as saying.   Greece and Italy claim that \"grappa\" and \"ouzo\" are two popular spirit   brands solely used by Greek and Italian producers. Their objection to   South Africa using the two brands had put on hold the South African-EU   agreement which was originally scheduled to be implemented in January   this year.

The heads of state or government of the 113-member NAM, gathered in   South Africa\\'s Indian 0cean coastal city of Durban for a two-day   meeting, hammered out a new strategy for the future of developing   countries in the coming few years.   The final document issued at the end of the summit noted that continued   acts of violence in Africa perpetrated by terrorist groups against   innocent civilians, have caused instability and severe disruption of   development efforts in the continent.   It supports the efforts made by African countries toward the resolution   of incipient and persistent conflicts in the continent and called on   the international community to support these efforts.   On disarmament and international security, the leaders reiterated that   with the end of the Cold War, there is no justification for the   maintenance of of nuclear arsenals, or concepts of international   security based on developing military alliances and policies of nuclear   deterrence.   The heads of state and government called for an international   conference in 1999, to reach an agreement on a phased program for the   the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.   Referring to international economic situation, the document said that   while the globalization and liberalization trend is expected to lead to   increasing economic opportunity for developing countries, many   developing countries continue to be marginalized.   Central focus of international efforts should be put in the creation of   an environment where the developing countries will \"be able to   successfully enter, compete and benefit from the globalization\", it   noted.   The leaders also stressed the need for new financial flows to debtor   countries, in addition to debt-relief measures. They urged creditor   countries and financial institutions to continue to extend concessional   financial assistance, particularly to the least developed countries.   The two-day NAM summit was attended by 65 heads of state and   government. Seven observer countries including China were present at   the summit.',\n",

Information Ministry officials told journalists the 10 were from the   Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebel group,   and had been captured some three weeks ago in an offensive by   government troops in the northern county of Lofa.   The spokesman of the group, Captain George Tamba, who claimed he had   formerly served in the now-defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia   (NPFL), said seven other LURD rebels were shot dead after their   surrender to the government forces.   The NPFL was the rebel group headed by Charles Taylor before he became   the country\\'s president in 1999.   Wednesday\\'s ceremony, held at the Information Ministry in Monrovia, was   witnessed by officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross   and United Nations.

The government also pardoned three members of the Krahn ethnic group   who were serving 20 years in prison following their conviction on   treason charges.   Last week, the Liberian government also pardoned Raleigh Seekie,   founding chairman of the defunct ULIMO group, which later disintegrated   into Krahn and Mandingo factions.

       " 'training-1383': {'body': \"   former Premier Silvio Berlusconi said Thursday he has sold part of his   TV and advertising unit to a Saudi prince and publishing groups from   Germany and South Africa.   At least for now, the mogul is keeping the controlling share, but he   announced further sales of stakes aimed at ultimately leaving his   family with a 35-40 percent slice.   The dlrs-1.12 billion deal will help his Fininvest business world,   whose debt stood 3.2 trillion lire (dlrs 2 billion) last year.   Berlusconi told a news conference it was a ''good financial deal.''   But whether the deal will quiet his critics as Italian political   leaders gear up for parliamentary elections, possibly later this year,   remained to be seen.   Asked if the deal didn't really resolve the conflict-of-interest issue,   Berlusconi replied: ``Even a person with 1 percent'' (in stakes) would   be attacked politically in Italy.   ``Conflict of interest is an invention of our political opponents,''   said Berlusconi, who leads the conservative Forza Italia party.   ``Right now the conflict does not exist since I'm not premier. If I am   given the premiership again, after new elections, I would freeze my   remaining (media) assets and put them under control of other (Mediaset)   partners,'' Berlusconi said.   During his premiership, Berlusconi had made similar promises, but   nothing came of them by the time he quit as premier in December, in   part because of the conflict-of-interest question.   Now, after months of negotiations, the stake will be divided this way:   Germany's Kirch Group 12.5 percent, Johann Rupert's Richemont Group of   South Africa 7.1 percent and Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal Abdulaziz   al-Saud, a nephew of King Fahd, 5.1 percent for a total of 24.7   percent.   After a second planned capital increase, Berlusconi said, the three   buyers' shares would be diluted to 10, 5.7 and 4.1 percent   respectively, for just under 20 percent.   Among potential buyers of stakes are banks, including Fininvest   creditors.   The first two sales should total about dlrs 2.2 billion, Berlusconi   said.   A third sale is planned, for stock market investors, next year.   Demands that Berlusconi sell off his media empire, which also includes   a newsweekly and film companies, began after the entrepreneur jumped   into politics less than two years ago. Among the most insistent critics   were his leftist opponents, including former Communists.   ``I don't know the details but if you're talking about the sale of 20   or 25 percent of Mediaset, certainly, it doesn't seem to me that the   antitrust problem is headed for a solution,'' said the government's   media watchdog Giuseppe Santaniello.   Mediaset includes Italy's three main private TV networks, Rete Quattro,   Canale Cinque and Italia Uno.   Earlier this year Morgan Stanley put Mediaset's value at about 7.5   trillion lire (dlrs 4.6 billion).   Earlier on Thursday, News Corp. Ltd. chairman and chief executive   Rupert Murdoch confirmed that he wasn't part of the deal.   He has held talks with Berlusconi, who said Thursday that Murdoch could   still buy a stake.   Murdoch had insisted on a controlling stake, according to news reports,   and Berlusconi said Thursday that he thought that would go against   Italian national interests. What's more, he said, the potential tax   liability of such a deal was too great.   Further convincing him not to sell to Murdoch was the defeat last month   of an Italian voter referendum that called for him to sell off part of   his TV empire.   Even if he succeeds in stopping the conflict-of-interest critics,   Berlusconi still faces another challenge. Prosecutors are seeking the   indictment of him and other Fininvest executives for allegedly paying   bribes to tax inspectors.\",\n",

Italy\\'s coach Arrigo Sacchi, unhappy with the co-ordination of his back   four since knee surgery sidelined Baresi, has spent the week   experimenting with Maldini in the centre rather than in his normal   left-back role.   Although Maldini only turned 26 last week, he has been a regular in the   Italian side for seven years and has also taken over the captaincy from   Baresi.   \"I don\\'t think the coach has completely made up his mind but I\\'m   expecting to play in the middle,\" Maldini said at the Italians\\' New   Jersey training base on Sunday.   The switch will mean Parma\\'s Luigi Apolloni, who came on when Baresi   was injured against Norway and kept his place for the final group game   with Mexico, is likely to return to the bench with Antonio Benarrivo   replacing Maldini on the left.   Italy will face a double strike spearhead for the first time in the   tournament against Nigeria and Sacchi is trying to counter their   dangerous front duo of Rashidi Yekini and Emanuel Ammunike.   Sacchi is also expected to recall Roberto Donadoni in midfield in place   of Nicola Berti and give veteran forward Daniele Massaro his first   start up front.   Massaro, who scored twice for Milan in the European Cup final, came on   for the second half of the 1-1 draw with Mexico and made an immediate   impact by firing Italy ahead.   If he replaces Pierluigi Casiraghi, Massaro will be the third striking   partner Roberto Baggio has had in four matches in USA \\'94.   Casiraghi led the attack in the last two games after Giuseppe Signori,   who played alongside Baggio in the opening loss to Ireland, was   switched to a more familiar wide role.   Sacchi is also concerned about the state of Dino Baggio, the Italians\\'   matchwinner against Norway and a key organiser in midfield.   \"Dino has not played a full game for Juventus all spring and he is   feeling the lack of conditioning. We will not risk him if he is not 100   per cent on Monday.\"   If Dino Baggio fails to make it, Antonio Conte is likely to come in.',\n",

Throughout the day the \"people\\'s radio\" broadcasts a long series of   communiques calling on public servants to return to work and on local   residents to rejoin their homes as \"there is nothing to fear.\"   The so-called \"president\" of this state within a state is   Laurent-Desire Kabila, who grabbed world headlines last month when his   troops launched a rebellion against the central government sparking a   massive exodus of mainly Hutu Rwandan refugees.   Kabila\\'s well-organized troops managed to eject from Goma, the capital   of north Kivu province, and from Bukavu, government troops as well as   Rwandan Hutu militias or former members of the Rwandan Armed Forces   (RAF) who had fled to Zaire following the 1994 inter-ethnic genocide of   more than half a million people in neighboring Rwanda. Most of those   killed were Tutsis or moderate Hutus.   Although the rebels, most of them Zairean Tutsis known as   Banyamulengue, failed in their bid to overthrow the government, they   succeeded in consolidating their hold on the eastern part of the   country, where they have set up an autonomous administrative network   aimed at reassuring the population.   Local radio continuously broadcasts the decisions taken by \"president\"   Kabila, including the appointment of a new governor for south Kivu   province, a new mayor and various other civil servants who are shown on   television being sworn in to their new post.   Kabila himself has set up his headquarters in the residence of the   former governor appointed by Kinshasa and daily meets with his new   appointees and local residents to try and restart the economy of this   agriculturally rich region and convince locals that he is their   protector.   Most residents appear satisfied, at least for now, with their new ruler   and cite improved security and a gradual return to law and order as   their reasons.   \"Before, we were shaken down by Zairean soldiers at every roadblock,   houses were looted but now all that is over, the president has   imprisoned the thieves,\" said one Lebanese merchant.   An Indian storeowner said he had received assurances that he would be   granted a pass so that his trucks could travel freely all the way to   Goma.   As for Kabila, he bursts out laughing when asked whether his aim is to   set up an autonomous state in the Kivu region as was the case in 1960   in Shaba province.   \"I am not from Kivu,\" he says, seated in one the former governor\\'s   gilded couches and wearing a grey safari jacket and sandals. On his   head is a cap bearing the name of the Spanish resort town of Marbella.   \"The next step for me is Kinshasa,\" he adds.',\n",

       " 'training-1547': {'body': \"   Rebels kidnapped two Britons and a local worker in an attack on a   U.S.-owned mine Friday and threatened to kill at least five Europeans   seized earlier from another mine, officials said.   Fierce fighting was continuing around the two mines, a Defense Ministry   spokesman said. He said they were ``bombing'' the area but that could   not be confirmed.   The U.S. company, Nord Resources of Dayton, Ohio, said it was   evacuating mine workers from the site.   The rebels said they would start killing hostages unless foreign   nations, particularly Britain, stop arming the military government   they've been fighting for three years, a Western diplomat said on   condition of anonymity.   The rebellion against the government of Capt. Valentine Strasser, who   seized power in 1992, has forced about 1.5 million people from their   homes. There are no estimates of deaths because much of the fighting is   in remote areas. Fighting has intensified in recent months and spread   closer to the capital Freetown.   Britain's Foreign Office confirmed that Peter White and Andrew Young   were taken hostage Friday in fighting at Sierra Rutile, a titanium   dioxide mine 80 miles (130 kms) southeast of Freetown co-owned by Nord   and by Consolidated Rutile Ltd. of Australia. It is the world's second   biggest producer of rutile, used for paint pigment.   Nord Resources said one Sierra Leone and two British nationals were   kidnapped. It said the mine was defended by local troops. It said   Sierra Rutile employs about 2,000 people including 20 expatriates, most   of whom are British, and 130 other contract personnel, mostly   Malaysian.   Rutile spokesman Philip Palmer said 300 employees -- including 30 to 40   Westerners -- and 100 Malaysians were evacuated by barge from an   Atlantic Ocean dock not far from the mine. Palmer was unsure of the   Westerners' nationalities.   Wednesday's attack took place at the nearby Sierra Leone Ore and Metal   Co., a large bauxite mine at Mokanji, 60 miles (100 kms) southeast of   Freetown, that belongs to the Swiss aluminum company Alusuisse. The   mine has 700 employees.   Diplomats in Freetown and British and Swiss government spokesmen said   between five and 10 foreigners were kidnapped, including citizens of   Britain, Germany, and Switzerland and a man with dual Australian-Swiss   nationality.   The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it was negotiating for the release of   its nationals.   A Sierra Leone official said the hostages taken Wednesday included four   Britons, five Swiss and one American, but the U.S. Embassy said no   Americans were being held.   Alusuisse spokesman Christoph Abt, speaking in Zurich, said soldiers   evacuated all the workers and their families from Mokanji by helicopter   and truck on Thursday, after government troops drove rebels from the   town.   The rebels delivered their death threats through Sierra Leonean workers   who they had captured. The message, addressed to the British High   Commission, was carried by Sheila Westwood, wife of kidnapped mine   manager James Westwood.   Britain is the former colonizer of Sierra Leone, a West African nation   of 4.5 million people settled by freed slaves from Britain, Jamaica and   the United States.   Since independence in 1961, it has suffered a slow decline marked by   coups and contested elections in which hundreds of people were killed.   The rebellion, led by Foday Sankoh and his Revolutionary United Front,   has eroded living conditions since it began in 1989, leading the United   Nations to list Sierra Leone as the world's worst place to live in   1992.   Strasser ousted another military dictator in 1992 and promised to end   the war, but has solidified his dictatorial grip.   Foreigners were not affected until last year. In March, an Irish priest   and a Dutch physician and his family were killed in an attack in   Panguma, 140 miles east (230 kms) of Freetown. In July, an Irishman and   a German were wounded in an ambush.   Two British engineers were the first foreigners taken hostage, in   November. They were allowed to make radio contact with the British High   Commission on Friday for the first time since their capture, the   Volunteer Services Overseas aid agency said.   Londoner Robert D'Cruz, 30, and Calum Murray, 24, of the Isle of Lewis   in Scotland, said they were healthy and in good spirits but missed   their families, according to the agency's spokesman Blake Lee-Howard.   On Jan. 3, a Swiss man was kidnapped by rebels who ambushed a minibus   and killed nine civilians. He has not been heard of since.\",\n",

       " 'training-0019': {'body': '   French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette pledged to try to boost   relations between Paris and Algiers after a meeting here Thursday with   Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.   After an hour-long meeting that looked at the full gamut of bilateral   links, he said France was ready \"to take a new lead in Franco-Algerian   relations.\"   De Charette\\'s two-day visit to Algeria, which began Wednesday, is the   first by a French minister to its former colony in three years.   The new start was based on the principles of \"mutual respect and a   common interest in jointly resolving questions that affect both   countries,\" he said.   Algeria has been wracked by civil war in which more than 50,000 people   have died since the government annulled elections in January 1992 which   the Islamic opposition was poised to win.   The decision to cancel the elections was criticised by France at the   time, and the violence that followed has frequently spilled over into   France with a spate of bomb attacks, including a terror campaign last   summer in which eight people were killed and more than 100 wounded.   Speaking on France 2 television, De Charette said both countries had   agreed to step up their dialogue in every aspect.   However, although he passed on a message of goodwill from French   President Jacques Chirac, he said there had been no discussion of   whether Chirac himself would visit Algeria.   A meeting between Chirac and Zeroual last October was cancelled at the   last minute, and Algiers later accused Paris of meddling in its   internal affairs.   De Charette said he had also meet French religious leaders in Algeria,   for talks centred on the assassination by Islamic fundamentalists of   seven French Trappist monks in May.',\n",

       " 'training-1211': {'body': \"   ownership of stations that make up the core of the Fox TV network.   An NBC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the network   will file a petition Wednesday to the Federal Communications   Commission, which regulates radio and TV broadcasters.   The petition will ask the FCC to set standards for all companies to   receive waivers from federal foreign ownership restrictions, if the   agency decides to give Fox a waiver from those restrictions, the   official said.   ``We don't want the FCC to carve another multibillion exception to   Fox,'' the official said, referring to some regulatory breaks the   fledging network has gotten from federal regulators over the years.   NBC's latest assault on Fox was first reported in the New York Times on   Wednesday.   The petition builds on a complaint filed earlier this year by the   National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a leading   civil rights group, which asserted that Fox has violated federal   foreign ownership restrictions.   The NAACP claimed that Fox masked its true corporate structure and that   foreign ownership denied opportunities to U.S. minorities. The FCC has   said since May that a ruling is imminent.   At issue is the ownership of six U.S. TV stations Fox bought in 1985 as   the foundation of its modern-day TV network.   Federal law and regulations bar a foreign company or individual from   owning more than 25 percent of a broadcast station.   According to Fox disclosures to the FCC this summer, all but 1 percent   of the dlrs 600 million used to purchase the stations was put up by   News Corp., a corporation based in Australia.   News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who became a U.S. citizen to buy   the stations, owns stock representing 76 percent of the voting rights   of Fox Television. The remaining 24 percent is held by News Corp.   Murdoch is a native Australian.   Fox made those disclosures in response to the NAACP petition.   Fox's president for network distribution and its chief Washington   lobbyist, Preston Padden, has said previously the stations' ownership   complies with federal restrictions.   The key question facing the FCC is who owns the stations -- Murdoch or   News Corp.   The stations, which were purchased from Metromedia Inc., are in   Washington, D.C., New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Houston.   NBC wants the FCC to rule that Fox either must sharply reduce its   foreign ownership level or let other U.S. networks seek unlimited   foreign ownership.   The FCC filing comes as the three major networks -- ABC, CBS and NBC --   face heated competition from the cable television industry as well as   from Fox.   Fox began broadcasting in 1986 and has grown with such hits as the   animated comedy series ``The Simpsons'' and the teen drama ``Beverly   Hills 90210.'' This season, Fox began broadcasting National Football   League games, a CBS staple for decades. It also has been aggressively   gaining local affiliates at the expense of its broadcast rivals.   According to the Times' report, a senior NBC executive speaking on   condition of anonymity said NBC would prefer it ``if the commission   took a pound of flesh from Murdoch: hit him with a heavy fine, and   maybe take some of his licenses.''   The planned petition is not NBC's first assault on Fox.   Two months ago, NBC attempted to block Fox from taking away an   affiliate in Wisconsin, a move that cast doubt on three other TV   station purchases Fox intends to make.\",\n",

The documents were salvaged from classified material that the Pentagon   demanded be destroyed in 1988 when George Herbert Bush succeeded Ronnie   Raygun as US President.   Bush was leaned on heavily by the Vatican to obliterate any references   linking the hiring of P2 Lodge thugs to assassinate John F Kennedy in   1963.

       " 'training-0016': {'body': \"   without incident Wednesday but Canadians still kept watch atop   observation posts for Serb army movements.   The Serb threat to shell the camp in Visoko within 48 hours passed by   mid-afternoon. The threat forced troops to adopt a high alert status,   filling sandbags, posting more look-outs and wearing flak jackets.   By dusk Wednesday, a cautious sense of relief spread through camp as   military data indicated no repeat of a Serb rocket attack on Sunday   which caused minor damage to a builing.   ``It's still seen as a possibility but getting more remote by the   day,'' Capt. Tom Newton, a camp spokesman, said of the possible attack   in a telephone interview. ``There's little reported activity in the   camp area.''   Canadians monitor Serb army troop and vehicle movements around their   camp by several means, including radio reports from 55 Canadians being   detained by Serbs at observation points and other locations near   Visoko.   ``People are uncomfortable with the whole idea of shelling obviously,   but they get used to the idea and get on with their job,'' said Newton,   30, a native of Victoria, B.C.   The camp was at the alert level of orange during daylight Wednesday and   was to stay at orange during the night. Orange requires personnel to   wear flak jackets outside. Non-essential trips outside camp are   cancelled.   The camp went to the highest level of red Monday night, forcing   personnel to sleep in bunkers and sea containers inside two camp   buildings.   About 400 Canadians remain in the Visoko camp at night. Since Monday,   100 non-essential personnel have slept in nearby Kiseljak. They return   to camp during the day.   Newton said there was no breakthrough Wednesday in negotiations to free   55 Canadians detained by Serbs at various sites near Visoko.   Things did not go well Wednesday for UN Secretary General Boutros   Boutros-Ghali who went to Sarajevo to work for a ceasefire and to   persuade Serbs to stop detaining 400 UN troops as insurance against   NATO airstrikes.   Serb leaders refused to meet him and the UN head was jeered by Sarajevo   residents while visiting the Muslim-led Bosnian government.   Prime Minister Jean Chretien spoke of the dilemma in an interview with   Paris daily Le Monde on Wednesday, saying, ``The peacekeepers in Bosnia   have become a sort of armed Red Cross, in a badly defined role.   ``To be in Bosnia is difficult for us,'' Chretien said. ``It's a   European problem, and we are North Americans. The Americans want to   control everything, and fight down to the last Canadian and   Frenchman.''   Of the NATO nations, France has 4,354 men in Bosnia, the largest single   contingent. Canada has about 2,000.   In the Visoko area, Maj. Dean Milner, the senior officer among Canadian   detainees, makes daily contact with his soldiers and Serb commanders.   ``Everything has been pretty cordial so far and they've (detained   Canadians) been treated fairly,'' said Newton, adding the 55 Canadians   are regularly supplied with goods.   Newton said the Serb threat has reduced peacekeeping efforts and   humanitarian aid in the area.   Soldiers also worry about the effect of media reports on Bosnia on   their families in Canada.   ``Everybody in camp just wants to give a call home and let everybody   know they're OK,'' said Newton.\",\n",

Tuesday night's Bullets-Knicks game marked the fourth consecutive   sellout at USAir Arena since Webber was traded to the Bullets from the   Golden State Warriors. It hardly mattered that the Bullets lost their   first three games with Webber. He has brought hope, excitement and   charisma to a young, rebuilding team.   According to Webber, the good times have just begun.   ``We're a better team now than before we made the trade,'' said Webber,   discussing the blockbuster deal that sent him to the Bullets in   exchange for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft picks.   ``I'm supposed to think like that. That's not cocky or meant as any   disrespect to Tom Gugliotta. I respect him as a player and as a person.   But I have confidence in myself.''   Why not? Webber, a 6-foot-10-inch power forward, was the NBA's Rookie   of the Year last season. And no one questions the 21-year-old's   multidimensional skills as a rebounder, shot-blocker, intimidator and   scorer.   Jim Lynam, the Bullets' coach, had the pleasure of coaching Charles   Barkley with the Philadelphia 76ers, and Lynam sees a lot of Barkley in   Webber.   ``I think it's a fair comparison -- I don't mean skill for skill, but   as an extraordinary athlete at the position,'' said Lynam.   And by joining the Bullets, Webber left behind his strained   relationship with Don Nelson, the Warriors' coach and general manager.   Webber no longer wanted to play for Nelson, and their differences   forced the Warriors to make the deal.   Webber was portrayed by many as being spoiled and selfish for   challenging one of the league's most-respected coaches and for leaving   a contending team. But Webber said today that the criticism was worth   the gain. And he continued to avoid discussing the specifics of his   rift with Nelson.   ``It wouldn't do anything but just raise discussions and have people   write articles,'' Webber said of his refusal to reveal why he and   Nelson could not resolve their differences.   ``I'm not trying to blast that man. He does what he does, he did what   he did, it's over with. I can sleep good at night. I'm happy now. I   couldn't sleep during the summer, and that has never happened before.

Webber, a Detroit native who can be a restricted free agent after the   season, said that he hopes to remain with the Bullets instead of   pursuing a contract with the Pistons. Joining the Bullets has reunited   Webber with Juwan Howard, the rookie forward who played with Webber at   Michigan. So far, Lynam has been happy with Webber, even though the   addition of Webber and Howard has altered the Bullets' chemistry.   Washington was 4-1 before the trade was made.   ``The people here are very excited, and rightfully so,'' said Lynam   while discussing the team's outlook.   ``You do the best you can. I can't put a timetable on it. Literally,   your guess would be as good as mine, or the guy that buys the tickets   could guess as to when we'll gel. But we have more talent now than when   we started the season.''   Now Webber wants to repay the new fan support with a few victories.s.   ``A lot of people are saying, `I told you so', because I'm here and   we're losing,'' Webber said. ``That's fine. I'm not a loser. I've never   lost with any team. We're going to win in the future. I'm not happy   that we're losing, but I know we're paying our dues and I know our day   is going to come. And that's going t make it much sweeter.''\",\n",

In an abrupt turnaround, Iraq announced late Friday a suspension of   attacks against Allied warplanes patrolling \"no-fly\" zones over its   territory.   The announcement, following mediation by Russia which condemned US   missile attacks earlier this month, came just hours after US F-117   Stealth and more F-16 fighters started to arrive in neighbouring   Kuwait.   Deputy Foreign Minister Ryadh al-Quasi said Baghdad\\'s climbdown on the   no-fly zones was sincere. \"Let\\'s hope that the American administration   will look at it that way and adopt the necessary measures,\" he said.   But the United States, which has vowed to avenge Iraqi challenges to   the exclusion zones for Iraqi aircraft imposed after the 1991 Gulf War   for Kuwait, responded with scepticism.   \"Actions speak louder than words and we\\'ll be looking at actions not   statements,\" said White House spokesman Michael McCurry.   \"It would be a wise move on Saddam\\'s part. It would be a step toward   defusing tensions in the Gulf,\" acknowledged Pentagon spokesman Kenneth   Bacon, taking a milder stand.   Saddam had declared last week that Iraq no longer recognizes the zones.   The United States went ahead with plans to send 5,000 troops to Kuwait   over the weekend and Defense Secretary William Perry was headed for   talks with US allies in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Pentagon   officials said.

Iraq was still confident however that its climbdown would foil any   further US attack.

The 30-year-old Edberg, now standing a respectable 17th after an   earlier slide into the mid 30\\'s, broke early in the second set and   never let 25th-ranked Henman into the contest to the delight of the   opening-night crowd.   \"It\\'s always tricky to play your first match of the week,\" said the   two-time Stuttgart winner.   Henman lost at the weekend in the semi-finals of the Ostrava tournament   to ultimate title winner David Prinosil.

Whether he is watching another minor league game or scampering through   another airport, Showalter's thoughts for almost two weeks now have   frequently drifted to what his players are doing. He wishes he knew.   Showalter claimed that he has not spoken to any players since the   strike began on Aug. 12 because he has been inundated with scouting   trips. After spending a few days at home in Pace, Fla., he went to Fort   Mill, S.C., and then to Columbus, Ohio, to scout the Yankees' Class AAA   Clippers. He is now in Albany, with the Class AA club.   What about the major league Yankees? They might as well have been   hiding on one of his flights.   ``You try to stay in touch with them, but you don't know what to do,''   Showalter conceded Wednesday, in a telephone interview from his Albany   hotel. ``It's a strange situation. It's weird. I don't know what to   do.''   It is permissible for Showalter to speak with his players during the   strike, so he could potentially retrieve answers about Mike Stanley's   bruised right hand, Don Mattingly's chronic right wrist injury or   whether Jimmy Key and Melido Perez are throwing consistently. But he   admitted that telephoning them would be an unusual and delicate matter   that he has so far avoided.   Even though Showalter has conversed with trainer Gene Monahan to get   updates on those who have injuries, a club spokesman said that no   Yankees have been sighted in the Bronx since the strike began. Paul   Gibson is the only Yankee who lives in the metropolitan area year-round   and he was at the strike negotiations Wednesday.   Still, Monahan has surely spoken to various players and has surely   reiterated the team's advice to remain in shape, similar to what he   does in the off season. When Showalter was told by a reporter that a   dozen calls to players on Tuesday afternoon did not find any of them   home, the manager quickly asked, ``Were they working out?''   Showalter was told that only Mike Gallego was discovered to definitely   be working out because the majority of calls drew responses from   answering machines or simply were not answered at all. Once so   optimistic about the possibility of a quick strike settlement,   Showalter sounded pessimistic Wednesday.   ``I think the next two or three days are going to be big,'' he said,   wondering whether a terminated season would render New York's 70-43   record meaningless. ``They got to get something rolling.''   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)   If baseball returns this season, Showalter is concerned about his   players returning in prime condition so their first-place standing in   the American League East is not jeopardized by lethargic play.   ``You have to have faith in your people that they'll be ready to   play,'' said Showalter. ``There will probably be a five- or six-day   period to get ready when and if they come back, so you'll have that to   work with.''

India\\'s foreign exchange reserves have touched the 28.5 billion us   dollar mark and the government has been urged to put the foreign   exchange earnings to productive use.   Under the new regulation, authorized dealers (ADs) could invest in   overseas joint ventures and wholly-owned subsidiaries abroad up to a   maximum of 15 million US dollars. The ADs can make these investments   abroad from balances in exchange earners foreign currency (EEFC)   accounts without referring to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).   \"Such investments would be permitted without reference to the norms and   guidelines in the existing policy on investments overseas,\" said a   Finance Ministry news release.   Presently, the RBI allows overseas investments up to 4 million US   dollars based on the export track record of a corporate house. It has   also been stipulated that the investable funds should not cross 25   percent of the export earnings, accrued in a block of three years.   Furthermore, the government in its new policy has also allowed the   corporates to invest 50 percent of funds raised through global   depository receipts (GDRs) in joint ventures and subsidiaries abroad.   Such investments will also not be subjected to the obligation of making   equal inward remittances over five years to neutralize the impact.   Besides, a special interministerial committee headed by the Commerce   Secretary will consider investments by Indian corporates with amounts   exceeding 15 million US dollars abroad. The funds over and above 15   million could be either funded through balances in EEFC accounts or   GDRs. Investments with a sizable GDRs AND EEFC component will be given   priority by the special committee.

       " 'training-1156': {'body': \"   painstaking and exacting work of creating an exquisitely detailed   diorama of an ancient longhouse village. The project is providing   McCarty, already a talented craftsman, an apprenticeship in tribal   history.   ``I like the museum because it does not represent a lost culture,''   McCarty said. ``It's nice to look at the artifacts and know where they   come from. Before I started working here, I didn't have the   appreciation I do now. It's so intense, the things I know now about the   way we lived. It's the origin of us. Sometimes I just have to sit   there.''   Preserving that culture is a stated priority in the tribe's plans.   ``Across the board, people on the reservation are interested in   controlled development,'' said Hottowe.   Renovating the harbor makes cultural as well as economic sense for a   tribe seeking to renew its bonds with the sea, said tribal manager   Smith.   In conjunction with the Battelle Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sequim,   Wash., the Makahs hope to create 3,000 private-sector jobs by the year   2020 through ``sustainable, environmentally friendly aquaculture.'' It   aims to be producing 20,000 metric tons of seafood a year by then.   Part of the harbor project's appeal is that the tribe won't have to   wait 25 years for jobs to be created. For example, a fish processing   plant that now handles four to five million pounds a year is expected   to handle up to nine million pounds after the marina is built.   In the winter, winds up to 100 miles per hour make the harbor dangerous   and keep fishermen from participating in winter fisheries. When   dredging is completed and the jetties and marina are built, they will   finally have a safe harbor, Simons said.   The marina could also help boost tourism in the modest way the tribe is   seeking.   ``With a better marina, a new restaurant, a laundromat and showers,   people with yachts, sport fishermen and large sailboats will stop   here,'' bringing business to tribal artisans who now lack a nearby   market for their crafts, Simons said.   Even now, small cruise ships stop at Neah Bay for a few hours while   their 200 to 300 passengers tour the museum. A better marina will   attract more, and tribal guides will lead them to the beaches and   bluffs to watch whales and rare birds.   The tribe also expects to benefit from the Olympic Coast National   Marine Sanctuary, dedicated this summer, which stretches from just off   the reservation south past Olympic National Park.   ``More species of whales, dolphins and porpoises spend time in these   waters than anywhere in the world,'' according to a sanctuary brochure.   And the sanctuary has some of the largest seabird colonies in the   United States.   Jeff Hottowe's ancestors were whalers, people of the cape who lived on   what the sea provided. Today the Makah are looking again to the sea to   help them preserve the ancient ways.   ``My father's voice doesn't carry as far as it once did,'' said   Hottowe. ``My family for generations has sung the songs. So I am   becoming a singer. And now I'm training my nieces and nephews, too.''\",\n",

Addressing the thirty-second session of the Commission on Population   and Development, Chinese delegate Yang Kuifu said China's population   totaled 1.25 billion, of which 370 million were urban residents and 870   million were rural.   Thanks to 20 years of family planning efforts, the birth rate has   declined from 33.4 percent in 1970 to 16.3 percent in 1998, and the age   structure of China's population was in the process of rapid change, due   to decreased fertility rates in a short time, Yang said.   By the year 2000, the number of people aged 60 years and older would   reach 130 million, making up 10 percent of the total population, Yang   said.   With the coming of the new century, she said, China faced increased   population pressures resulting from its huge number of people and the   aging of its population.   The Chinese Government believed that the key solution lay in its   commitments to develop the economy vigorously, enhance its   comprehensive national strength, integrate its population programs into   its general strategy for development, and utilize its natural resources   rationally, Yang said.   To addressing aging, China was placing a greater focus on the family   and social structures, and in that regard, China had recently passed a   law on the protection of elderly rights, which would, among other   things, improve social security systems, Yang added.\",\n",

Milovic, 33, said he hopes his family will join him. He didn't want to   talk yet about his war experience.   In the coming months, he must find a job and begin a new life.   He will stay in a small apartment and receive a week's supply of food.   The coalition and volunteers will help him find a job and learn   English.\",\n",

       " 'training-0954': {'body': \"   beyond doubt that he is a gentleman. But his refusal to wield the ax in   the wake of the Aldrich Ames affair, arguably the worst espionage case   in American history, has set in motion a process which could lead to   the end of the CIA, at least in its present form.   Little noticed amid the rancorous pre-electoral din issuing from   Capitol Hill, the Senate last week launched a bipartisan initiative for   a commission to review the Agency's entire role in the post Cold War   world.   No limits have been placed on its brief. To all intents and purposes,   said The New York Times, a demoralized CIA will be ``a company   undergoing a court-supervised bankruptcy reorganization.''   ``Wither The CIA ?'' was a question asked here well before revelation   of the Ames debacle. Hitherto however, the inclination had been to   allow it to be answered primarily by the agency itself.   Now the astoundingly light in-house punishment meted out by Woolsey   seems to have convinced Congress and the Clinton administration that   the CIA is incapable of putting its own house in order.   Last week, the long awaited report by CIA Inspector General Frederick   Hitz -- compiled largely on the basis of what Ames himself told   interrogators during months of questioning after his arrest last Feb.   21 -- laid out the appalling truth.   Between 1985 and 1993, Hitz writes, he caused the loss of ``virtually   all the CIA's human resources'' reporting on the Soviet Union.   He ruined much of its work elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and revealed to   Moscow the identity of scores of CIA staff working under diplomatic and   civilian cover.   The total damage, says Hitz, was ``truly staggering'': 10 agents   executed, 36 neutralized or turned, at least 55 compromised operations,   plus general CIA policy and planning documents of huge value to Soviet   and Russian intelligence.   Equally staggering was the CIA's failure to catch Ames. He was lazy,   frequently drunk, with a long record of ``no enthusiasm, little regard   for the rules, little security consciousness...few good work habits,   few friends and a bad reputation in terms of integrity, dependability   and discretion.''   All this was known, as was a lifestyle far beyond his apparent means.   Yet Ames' supervisors ``cleaned up after him, found words to praise   him'' and promoted him to positions which might have been handpicked by   the KGB.   Woolsey's response has been almost to turn the other cheek. He has   reprimanded only 11 CIA employees, six of them retired. No- one has   been sacked or even demoted. That was ``not my way, not CIA's way and   not the American way,'' said Woolsey. An outraged Congress begs to   differ.   This week, the Senate Intelligence Committee will produce its own   report and recommendations. And whatever it decides, those who favor a   complete revamp of the structure of American intelligence services will   have more grist for their mill.   The Ames disaster may have been unique, but even beforehand the CIA was   reeling from troubles enough: Iran-Contra, its slowness in spotting the   weaknesses of the old Soviet Union, and two lawsuits by former and   present female employees charging discrimination and abuse of women at   what they claim was little more than a hard-drinking Old Boys Club.   Suddenly the longstanding proposals to dismantle the CIA from Senator   Daniel Patrick Moynihan and others, presented well before the Ames   affair came to light, no longer look farfetched.   Under these blueprints, the agency's analytical and research side would   go to the State Department, while the Pentagon would take over its   spying and paramilitary activities. The FBI, meanwhile, would   exclusively handle molehunting.   The FBI indeed is one of the few to emerge with some credit from the   Ames debacle. It first alerted the CIA in the mid-1980s about his   suspicious contacts with Soviet officials.   At the very least big cuts are coming. President Bill Clinton is   committed to take US$7 billion out of the $28 billion annual   intelligence budget by 1998.   Only $3 billion of this is spent on the CIA proper: the lions' share is   believed to go on electronic eavesdropping. But the cost of its   disgrace will be borne across the intelligence community.\",\n",

       " 'training-0955': {'body': '   Jacques Delors, winding up his last EU summit as European Commission   chief Saturday, declined to reveal whether he intended to run as French   president amid persistent rumours here that he would.   French President Francois Mitterrand, also in the western German town   of Essen for the European leaders meeting, said Saturday he was not   keeping Delors\\' plans a secret, he just did not know.   Delors on Saturday repeated earlier statements that he would let it be   known before Christmas whether he would stand as a presidential   candidate next May when Mitterrand retires after 14 years in office.   Members of several delegations at the European Union summit said   Saturday they were convinced Delors would run for the French presidency   and announce his decision Sunday.   His mandate as commission president ends in January.   As the favoured Socialist candidate, Delors is leading in the polls. He   said earlier this week he had made a decision on the presidential poll   but would not specify whether he would run.   Refusing again to reveal his decision on Saturday, Delors sparked   speculation that he would announce his candidacy on French television   on Sunday when he is due to appear on the political 7/7 programme on   the TF1 channel.   \"I made an appointment to announce my decision on January 25, but that   turned out to be too late. I therefore indicated that in the event I   would not be standing as a candidate, I would make this known before   Christmas,\" Delors said at the summit closing press conference.   He said he had felt under an obligation to maintain discretion over his   plans because of his functions as EC president, and that he did not   feel authorised to make \"incursions into domestic politics\" just   because Essen had finished.   Facing a barrage of questions from journalists, he said he would   continue to \"fight for a united Europe\" and said he had \"lots of plans\"   in that respect.   Also speaking to journalists about Delors\\' intentions, Mitterrand said:   \"I just do not know.   \"I do not make suppositions. But even if I knew, I would not tell you,\"   the French head of state added with a smile.   Mitterrand praised \"the qualities and the enormous determination\" shown   by Delors in his role and said he would be remembered for his time as   EC president.   \"The European Union partners are sad to see him go,\" Mitterrand said.   \"He is a man who brings consensus,\" he said.   Heads of state and government of the 12 European Union states paid   tribute to Delors retiring after 10 years as president of the EU   executive commission.   \"His name is associated with what must be the 10 most successful years   of European unification,\" European leaders said in the conclusions of   their summit in Essen.   They said he was the \"prime mover\" in the so-called Single European Act   for the free movement of goods, services, capital and people from   January 1 1993.   In helping realise \"the visionary goal\" of a free European internal   market he made a decisive contribution to overcoming stagnation in the   early 1980s and \"imparting a new dynamism to the integration process\".   \"The second great achievement for which we essentially have Jacques   Delors to thank is economic and monetary union, the fundamental   grounwork of which was his,\" the European leaders said.   \"For this, as well as the high standards he has set, the heads of state   and government meeting in the European Council would like to express   their thanks and recognition,\" they went on.   \"His achievements for Europe will not be forgotten.

Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was quoted Monday as saying   that Japan would understand then that the EAEC did not oppose any   country, including the United States.   It would also realise that the caucus was not meant to counter any   trade bloc or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, of   which the United States is a member.   \"It is better for Japan to join the EAEC first, look at how it operates   and what it can achieve.

His remarks, which came after Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama   promised during a three-day visit here Sunday to \"seriously consider   further\" the EAEC, signalled Malaysia\\'s growing impatience with Japan\\'s   continued indecision to back the caucus.

The claim was made in a statement to the Irish state broadcaster RTE.   \"The attack mounted against the military installation was carried out   by one of our units,\" said the statement, signed by \"P. O\\'Neill, IRA\"   -- an IRA codename regularly used for such claims of responsibility.   Friday\\'s attack on the Quebec Barracks, in which three mortars were   fired from the back of a British-registered van parked outside the   compound, caused extensive damage to buildings but no injuries.   The IRA had been widely suspected, both in Britain and by German   police, of carrying out the attack.   (In Germany, police issued an appeal for witnesses to come forward with   information about the van -- a white and grey Ford Transit with the   British registration G74 OHD.)   The attack coincided with a Group of Seven industrialized nations\\'   summit in Lyons, France where terrorism was put at high on the agenda   at the behest of the United States after the bombing of a US military   base in Saudi Arabia.   It also came eight days after the discovery of an IRA weapons centre in   County Laois, in central Ireland. Four people were arrested, but of   greater interest was the seizure of what police called a new type of   mortar.   Jane\\'s Intelligence Review described the Mark 17 mortar as being one of   the deadliest weapons in the IRA arsenal. It was developed during the   17-month IRA ceasefire and tested in the Irish countryside.   The ceasefire ended in February with a car bomb attack in London\\'s   Docklands financial district that left two people dead.   Seven other attacks or attempted attacks in Britain followed,   threatening to detail the Northern Irish peace process -- from which   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has been excluded.   But Friday\\'s incident was the first by the IRA outside Britain in six   years.   In 1987-90, the IRA regularly hit British forces stationed in Germany.   One of the most serious incidents was in March 1987 when 30 were   wounded by a car bomb at a British military headquarters in   Rheindahlen.

And in the almost 50 years that have passed since his Stanley Kowalski   electrified the American theater, Marlon Brando's legend has expanded   until it has become an essential part of our shared cultural mythology.   If Marlon Brando did not exist, it seems, we would have had to invent   him.   Indeed, we have invented him anyway -- as the rebel with the broken   heart, the self-lacerating idealist, the Don Juan broken on a wheel of   flesh, the recluse brooding out a bloated endgame on a tropical island.   Whether these images have any basis in reality -- and for 40 years   Brando himself has snarled, when he could bring himself to speak at   all, that they do not -- hardly matters, for what Brando has come to   stand for is possibility itself.   The myth of Brando is the myth of the man who makes himself up as he   goes along -- who rises above fear to challenge Johnny Friendly, thumbs   his nose at everything that smacks of the hypocrisy of the ``real   world,'' sleeps with every woman, fights the demons in the last dark,   and dies with his eyes open.   Brando has bitterly rejected his own legend: To combat myth, he has   chosen silence. An intensely private man, he has granted only a handful   of interviews in the last 30 years. But -- in an irony that is no   longer unfamiliar in the age of spectacle -- his silence has only   heightened the aura that so nauseates him.   All of which explains the considerable excitement surrounding the   publication this week of Marlon Brando's long-awaited autobiography,   ``Songs My Mother Taught Me'' (Random House, $25, 468 pages). The great   sphinx has finally spoken: What made him break his long silence? And   what would he say?   The answer to the first question is not entirely clear, although money   -- Random House paid Brando a reported $6 million for the world rights   -- may have been involved.   As for the second question, the answer is: Not enough. Or perhaps too   much.   Whatever his faults, and they are many, Marlon Brando was never bland.   But ``Songs My Mother Taught Me,'' co-authored by Robert Lindsey, while   certainly several notches above the standard show-biz tell-all, never   catches fire. We are given all the information to construct a life, but   not the sense of life itself. Those colored lights never really get   going.   In his introduction, Lindsey, the former West Coast bureau chief for   the New York Times who also, oddly, co-wrote Ronald Reagan's memoirs,   explains that Brando turned to him after finding that ``he didn't have   the emotional reserve to write a full-blown autobiography. ... (He)   promised to hide nothing, to be completely honest with me and to answer   any questions I asked him about any topic I wanted except his marriages   and his children.'' The book is based on tape-recorded conversations   between the two men, edited by Lindsey and given final revision by   Brando.   Part of the book's problem is its form, or lack of it. No matter how   well edited -- and Lindsey has done a good job of pulling together a   coherent narrative -- as-told-to books tend to have an episodic,   meandering feeling. Internal tension and organic unity, the qualities   that raise autobiography to a literary art, are lost. If the subject   has an unusually potent voice, this can be overcome: Miles Davis'   pungent autobiography is an example. But on paper Brando -- who in his   films thundered and whispered, clamored and soared -- lacks such a   voice. And his refusal to engage the most painful and personal areas of   his life -- his tormented relationship with his first wife, Anna   Kashfi, the tribulations of his children -- while certainly   understandable, further limits the book's emotional range.   Which is not to say that Brando avoids confronting profoundly personal   issues. The emotional thread that runs through ``Songs My Mother Taught   Me'' is confessional -- a painful acknowledgment of the troubled,   loveless family life that drove him into decades of obsession and rage.   Brando's mother was an alcoholic, his father a philanderer and drunk, a   ``cold, unloving, selfish, infantile, terminally despicable and   self-absorbed'' man. Brando has included the heartbreaking letters he   sent as a lonely adolescent to his parents from military academy --   letters rarely answered.   Just as thousands of amateur psychologists had suspected, Brando's   public mask of scorn concealed a wounded inner child. ``If I had been   loved and cared for differently, I would have been a different   person,'' Brando says. ``I went through most of my life afraid of being   rejected and ended up rejecting those who offered me love because I was   unable to trust them.'' After years of analysis and self-examination,   Brando now says he has made peace with those who wounded him so deeply   -- and with himself. ``I ... finally realized that I had to forgive my   father or I would be entrapped by my hatred and anguish for the rest of   my life.''

       " 'training-1027': {'body': '   European diplomats have told Croatian President Franco Tudjman that   they are worried by rising tensions between Croats and Moslems in   Mostar in the south of Bosnia, where the two groups have shared power   since July of last year, the Hina news agency said Friday.   They have also expressed anxiety about the future of the federation   between Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina that came into being   following the Washington agreement of March 1994 and now appears at   risk from the Croatian side.   It was the second time in four days that European diplomats had   intervened to tell Tudjman of the need to safeguard the federation,   following an appeal by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Tuesday.   The news agency said that French ambassador Jean-Jacques Gaillarde,   respresenting the European Union, and Portuguese envoy Octavio Neto   Valeria, for the Western European Union, had handed Tudjman a note   outlining their fears.   Tudjman assured them that he would do everything in his power to have   the Washington agreement implemented and ensure the federation acquired   a vigorous identity and joined Croatia in a confederation, the agency   reported.   He also promised to give full support to the European adminstrators in   Mostar.   Kinkel had called on Tudjman to do his best to breathe new life into   the federation, the future of which has been called into question by   the promise made by the international community to the Bosnian Serbs   that they can enter a confederation with Serbia if they accept the   five-nation contact group\\'s peace plan.   The Bosnian Croats at once turned their back on the Croat-Moslem   federation, arousing press speculation that a deal was under way   between the Serbs and the Croats.   This would involve the the Croats reestablishing their control over the   Serb-occupied Krajina area of Croatia while withdrawing their support   from the Bosnian government.   Croatia and Bosnia are at present linked by a cooperation treaty, which   has a military dimension and the Washington agreement.   The European Union administrator in Mostar, Hans Koscnik of Germany,   sounded an alarm in Bonn recently when he accused the Bosnian Croats of   obstructing his mission to bring reconciliation and reunification to   the town.   The Moslem part of Mostar and an historic bridge were completely   wrecked by a year of Croatian bombardments which lasted from April 1993   to March 1994.   One of Koschnik\\'s staff, who asked not to be named, said the diplomatic   moves now under way \"were coming a bit late,\" in a reference to the   meeting due to be held in Munich in Germany this weekend between   Bosnian Croats and Moslems in an effort to strengthen their federation.   Recently Klaus Metscher, one of Koscnik\\'s deputies, said the present   situation resembled that before the bloody clashes of 1993 and 1994.   \"It is unforgiveable that we we should be back in a situation in which   clashes could break out again at any moment,\" the newspaper Slobodna   Dalmacija reported him as saying.   Troops of the Bosnian Croat army (HVO) surrounded the building housing   the administration in Mostar last Friday to secure the release of a   Croat accused of raping a Moslem, United Nations forces have reinforced   security there and along the line separating the two communities.',\n",

Ferrasse will continue as president of the International Amateur Rugby   Federation (FIRA), which the French set up in 1931 when they were   thrown out of the five nations championship over allegations of   professionalism.   \"And we\\'ll stay amateur,\" he said.   He said French clubs could not afford to go professional and applauded   Lapasset\\'s decision to reject all-out professionalism.   However, the FFR\\'s legal committee will have to find a loophole in a   new law which could force rugby clubs to register as companies. The   legislation affects any sports club making payments of any kind   amounting to 2.5 million francs a year -- a sum every French first   division club surpasses.   As a registered company they would be unable to benefit from tax   concessions and local authorities, who have already been ordered to end   grants by 1998, would be unable to offer them free use of   municipality-owned grounds.   The move could hurt sponsorship. Companies might be unable to set aside   sponsorship against tax liabilities, as rugby\\'s current status as an   amateur sport allows them.   The situation is made more complicated by the fact that players who had   been declaring payments as expenses were ordered to make social   security contributions on earnings last year.',\n",

The virtually unprotected banks in security-obsessed Israel   don't seem to care.   But police are not amused.   As officials met with bank directors Monday to urge improved security,   low-tech lawbreakers staged the 47th and 48th heists of a summer crime   wave.   The take, as usual, was modest _ the equivalent of $10,000 in Jerusalem   and a quarter that sum in Tel Aviv. So were the getaways: the   perpetrators fled on foot.   A frustrated Police Minister Moshe Shahal told bank directors Monday   that the time had come for stronger measures to stop ``the robberies   that have become a phenomenon.''   Tel Aviv police chief Gabi Last said these measures included   closed-circuit television cameras, security guards and special alarms.   Nissim Barel, security chief for the Banking Association, said the   banks are ``considering buying new technologies that will enable us to   report to the police quicker (so) that reaction time will be a matter   of seconds.''   But Discount Bank chairman Gideon Lahav said armed guards are unlikely.   No one knows exactly what sparked the fad. Tabloids have hailed the new   ``national sport,'' while state-run TV bemoaned ``the unbearable   lightness of stealing.''   ``Perhaps the banks should set up a special counter for robberies, to   save time and nerves for robbers and tellers both,'' suggested   commentator Yosef Lapid in the Maariv daily.   Police experts say most of the robbers are small-time thieves or drug   addicts encouraged by the publicity.   Reports have focused on cooperative bank tellers generally instructed   by jittery managers to avoid heroics that could unbalance the lucrative   banking industry.   Instead, banks limit the amount of money accessible to tellers to what   constitutes an acceptable write-off, an investigator said. And large   heists are unlikely as bank safes have a delay mechanism that would   force robbers to cool their heels for 10 long minutes before gaining   entry.   Only 12 suspects have been arrested in the latest wave.   One man was caught last month when police matched him to fingerprints   on the robbery note he carelessly left with the teller.   Another robber, a 65-year-old man, succeeded in plundering three banks   with the aid of a toy gun and a monkey mask before he was collared by   alert citizens outside a Tel Aviv bank.\",\n",

Now, among others, there are the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democratic   Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party.   A new name was announced Thursday -- the New Frontier Party -- but its   formation means the end of six parties and several splinter groups,   including the Liberals and Democratic Socialists.   A group of 225 opposition lawmakers forming the new party voted on the   name after hiring a panel of experts to sift through 12,000 public   suggestions.   The party, to be formally launched Dec. 10, will be Parliament's second   largest, and has a fair shot at taking power from the current ruling   coalition whenever elections are held, perhaps next year.   The current ruling group combines the Liberal Democrats and Social   Democrats, better known simply as the Socialists.   And then, the name New Frontier Party isn't set in stone.   In Japanese, it's the ``Shinshinto.''   Party public information chief Yuriko Koike first announced a more   literal translation: ``New Progressive Party.'' But another party   member who lived in the United States for 20 years, Wakako Hironaka,   suggested that ``progressive'' had connotations of left-wing ideology.   A few hours later, Koike settled on ``New Frontier Party.'' She   cautioned that the party is not necessarily linking itself with John F.   Kennedy, who used ``new frontier'' as a slogan during his presidential   term.   Shinshinto was one of five finalist names selected by the expert panel.   The others translate as Hope Party, Pure New Party, New Wind Party and   Human Party.   It's no accident that all five names share a certain vagueness about   what the new party stands for. Despite its name, the New Frontier   Party's policies have not departed from territory comfortably settled   by the conservative Liberal Democrats, who governed Japan from 1955 to   last year and returned to power this June as the largest party in a   coalition.   Kikuo Nomoto, an eminent linguist who headed the panel, conceded that   with a committee involved, it was inevitable that ``commonplace'' names   would result.   ``It's difficult to pick something unique that will surprise people,''   he said in a telephone interview.   Critics might also object to the ``new'' in the party name, since   several of the party's leaders have been embroiled in money scandals   that typify old-style Japanese politics.   But the party keeps insisting that it will stand for ``unwavering   reform'' of government red tape and old-style patronage politics. That,   combined with the fresh-sounding name, is aimed at winning over voters   who say they are tired of incessant corruption.   ``It's good if the image comes out strongly,'' said party legislator   Kunio Hatoyama, a former education minister.\",\n",

The decision was made at a meeting of the National Environment   Committee (NEC), and the meeting also agreed to ban in phases the   import of two-stroke engines, which emits black smoke into the   atmosphere, as part of a set of anti-pollution measures.   The NEC asked the concerned ministries to take measures for increasing   the use of jute and clothes to obviate the adverse impact of polythene   on the environment.   Those present at the meeting had a detailed discussion on the   production and limited use of polythene, controlling black smoke and   environment pollution by tannery industries.   The NEC meeting decided to gear up the drives at different points to   stop emission of black smoke from vehicles.

That was a reference to the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel   captured east Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, West Bank, all territories the   Palestinians want as part of an eventual state.   He stressed that support for \"a Palestinian state must be accompanied   by talk of a timetable,\" and warned that if the state \"is not   established on Palestinian land within a reasonable period of time and   with the agreement of the concerned parties, violence will continue.\"   He also said he hoped Syria and Lebanon would be brought into the peace   process to bring a \"comprehensive\" peace to the region. Israel also   captured territory from Syria in 1967, which it is still holding.   The king also said the future of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was   only for the Palestinian people to decide. \"It is a very serious matter   to let others think for peoples,\" he said.   As for Iraq, the king warned that any military action against Baghdad   would be \"a catastrophe not just for Iraq but for the entire region.\"   \"We are still requesting a solution to the dispute between Iraq, the   United States and the United Nations.

Basayev added, however, that he was prepared to \"cooperate with   Russia.\"   \"I would even be ready to take up a place at table with the worst of   the Russian devils if anything whatsoever could be got out of it for   us,\" he said.   Russian forces invaded Chechnya in late 1994 to quash the republic\\'s   independence bid. A peace agreement was signed between the two sides in   August last year and the republic is due to hold presidential and   legislative elections this month.   Basayev said collaboration with Russia would only be his fourth   priority if he were elected.   \"I would put independence for the republic in top position, then a   determined war on crime would be undertaken, thirdly we would need to   improve the people\\'s situation quickly, and fourthly I would cooperate   with Russia,\" he said.   Basayev, who described as his models Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara,   Italian general Giusppe Garibaldi, and former French and US presidents   Charles de Gaulle and Franklin Roosevelt, said legislation would be   based on Chechen traditions and the sharia, or Islamic law, if he were   elected.   \"We are expecting no presents from the West,\" he said. \"What is   important for us is that the West stops financing Russia\\'s imperialist   ambitions ... The West has paid 20,000 dollars for the death of every   Chechen and 100,000 Chechens died in total.\"   Most estimates suggest that around 40,000 people, Russians and   Chechens, died during the 21-month war.   Basayev is best known for carrying out a raid on the town of   Budyonnovsk in southern Russia in June 1995. Over 1,000 people were   taken hostage and at least 150 killed during the crisis.   Basayev himself escaped after negotiating an exit with Russian Prime   Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.   Basayev is one of 16 candidates running for president in the January 27   election.

       " 'training-2430': {'body': '   Despite calls to extremists on both side to calm down as tensions rose   between Romania and Hungary, the ethnic Hungarian minority here is   coming under sustained fire again because of its political claims to   autonomy.   In a bid to defuse the crisis, government officials began talks this   week at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Hungarian   Democratic Federation of Romania on Romanian-Hungarian relations. The   government\\'s top official for minority affairs, Viorel Hrebenciuc, is   taking part in the dialogue.   In a radio interview from there Federation leader Bela Marko complained   that there was \"an enormous contradiction\" between what was happening   in Romania and the statements its official representatives made abroad.   He was referring to a resolution passed by parliament here the day   before the Carter Center talks opened, criticising him for \"extremist   remarks.\"   Marko has accused the authorities of trying to assimilate the Hungarian   minority, which according to official figures numbers 1.7 million   people, or 7.1 percent of the country\\'s population.   Marko also questioned the constitution\\'s definition of Romania as a   national state, which he said was incompatible with respect for   minority rights. His party voted against the constitution in December   1992.   The coalition government\\'s leading component, the Party of Social   Democracy, formerly the Democratic National Salvation Front, and its   nationalist and ex-communist allies on Monday presented draft   legislation which would require members of parliament and other elected   persons, plus top civil servants, to swear an oath of loyalty to the   constitution and the Romanian state.   Such a move would put the Hungarian movement under severe pressure, and   Marko has already warned that isolating the party could radicalise it   and its electorate.   The government said last week it would probe a ceremony the Federation   organised in a small town in Transylvania in memory of a Hungarian   author at which the Hungarian national anthem was sung and Hungarian   flags flown.   A 1994 law restricts the use of foreign emblems on Romanian territory   to official visits, international meetings and sports competitions.   Offenders are liable to up to three years in prison.   Increasing the isolation of the Hungarian minority party, which won   7.45 percent of the vote in the 1992 general election, is a reminder   from other opposition parties that it must undertake to respect the   constitution, otherwise further cooperation would be impossible.   There was a storm at the end of January when the Hungarian movement was   threatened with a ban for yet again staking its claim to autonomy on an   ethnic basis.   Calm returned when neighbouring Hungary made its displeasure clear.   Romania has to be careful about such political turmoil as it is   negotiating a friendship treaty with Hungary and hopes it can be signed   before March 21, when a conference on stability in Europe is to be held   in France.   Concerned for its international reputation, the president\\'s office has   called all \"extremists\" to order.   That meant not just Marko\\'s wilder followers.   There were harsh words too for fervid Romanian nationalist Gheorghe   Funar, leader of the Party of Romanian National Unity, who was warned   there could be no further cooperation with the authorities if he failed   tone down his anti-Magyar rhetoric.',\n",

The Department said that May deficit shot up a 14.8 percent increase   from the 18.6 billion dollars deficit in April.   U.S. imports of goods and services climbed 2.2 percent to a record high   of 98.9 billion dollars in May, reflecting higher oil prices and a big   jump in auto shipments.   Meanwhile, U.S. exports fell 0.8 percent to 77.6 billion dollars as   demand dropped sharply for commercial aircraft, farm products and   USA-made autos.   So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate   of 225 billion dollars, more than one-third higher than last year's   record high of 164.3 billion dollars.   U.S. manufacturers and farmers have been battered by the world   financial turmoil, which forced U.S. companies to compete with a flood   of cheaper imports. Manufacturing sector has cut 488,000 jobs since   March 1998 and farmers are suffering their worst economic crisis in a   decade.   However, the overall U.S. economy has continued to post robust growth   as consumer spending has remained strong.   The trade deficit in goods and service has set a record in four of the   last five months, reflecting the fact that a strong U.S. economy has   propelled demand for imports while U.S. companies and farmers have seen   their overseas sales shrink.   Prices of imported crude oil have rebounded in recent months, sending   U.S. oil bill sharply higher.   The price of crude oil jumped to 14.54 dollars a barrel in May, up from   12.71 dollars in April and the highest price since December 1997.   Rising crude prices offset a smaller volume of imported oil to boost   the bill for foreign oil by 12.8 percent, to 5.3 billion dollars.   Imported autos and auto parts were up 6 percent in May to 14.5 billion   dollars.   The decline in U.S. exports included a drop of 221 million dollars in   sales of commercial aircraft, a drop of 283 million dollars in sales of   consumer goods and a fall of 129 million dollars in sales of U.S.   autos.   Also, farm sales fell by 29 million dollars with exports of meat, rice   and corn all down.   The U.S. deficit with Japan shrank by 6.7 percent in May to 5.3 billion   dollars but for the first five months of this year is still running 6.5   percent above the 1998 levels.   But the May deficit with Western Europe rose to 3.6 billion dollars,   the biggest imbalance since July 1998. Rising trade tensions with   Europe have led the Clinton administration to impose economic sanctions   on more than 300 million dollars in European luxury imports in disputes   involving U.S. banana companies and beef producers.   The deficit with Mexico in May climbed to 2.2 billion dollars, the   second-highest level on record.   Analysts said that the swelling trade deficit might fuel the   government's worry of growing cries for protection from U.S.   industries, ranging from steel producers to apple growers.\",\n",

Subsidies are also available for enterprises which absorb laid-off   workers. For example, enterprises can receive subsidies of 4,000-6,000   yuan per middle-aged laid-off worker employeed for more than two years.   \"The private sector has played an important role in absorbing laid-off   workers, and more preferential policies will be formulated to encourage   the trend,\" according to You Lantian, director of the Municipal Labor   Bureau.

       " 'training-1844': {'body': \"   The German coalition government reached a compromise Thursday on a   modest reform of the country's 86-year-old bloodlines citizenship law,   Interior Minister Otto Schily said.   Under the reform, foreign children born in Germany will automatically   receive German citizenship and be allowed to remain dual-nationals   until aged 23 when they will have to choose a single nationality.   Currently, children born to foreigners in Germany are not allowed to   receive German citizenship even in the third or fourth generation,   unless they go through a complex and expensive naturalization process   and agree to give up their foreign passport.   The new law will also allow adult foreign residents in Germany to apply   for German citizenship after eight-year instead of the current 15-year   waiting period.   Applicants will be judged on three criteria: allegiance to the German   constitution, ability to speak German, and a crime-free record, said   Schily, adding that adult dual-nationality will be barred except for   foreigners living longer than 30 years in Germany or aged over 60.   The bill is backed by the Greens Party, the junior partner in   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition. The compromise bill came   after the government ditched plans to offer dual-nationality to 7. 3   million foreigners living in Germany.   Anger in Germany over the planned dual-nationality option helped the   defeat of Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) in Hesse, where they had   been in coalition with the Greens.   Changing the citizenship law requires approval of parliament's upper   chamber, the Bundesrat, which represents Germany's 16 states.   Schroeder's SPD has lost control of the Bundesrat after being defeated   in Hesse state election.   The key to get the compromise bill passed was approval of the tiny Free   Democratic Party (FDP) serving within a coalition with SPD in   Rhineland-Palatinate state.   The FDP, strongly against offering adult foreigners dual- nationality,   had the final say on the extent of the reform in negotiations with   Schily in Mainz on Thursday.   Hesse's SPD-FDP government will now vote for the bill, which is   expected to be approved by both chambers before the summer   parliamentary recess.\",\n",

Teachers have already been trained to be creative in order to implement   the reforms.

The   teachers will observe the students and identify their skills   competencies and behavioral patterns when they participate in these   games. It will also enable the teacher to identify mental and physical   strengths of the children.   In a fact finding mission it was found that by using environment   successfully teachers had managed to create learning situations and   environmental friendly attitudes and arouse curiosity among the   children.   The new curriculum comprises language, religion, mathematics and   environment based activities. It is a competency based curriculum with   a mixture of knowledge, competencies, attitudes and values.   The new reforms envisage employing one teacher for two years at one key   stage.

Edelman, chairman of the MTA. ``But we're still   far apart.''   In their first estimate of ridership since the strike began, MTA   officials said there were about 200,000 passenger boardings on   contingency lines Monday -- down from 1.2 million on a typical weekday.   MTA officials said there were probably a similar number of boardings   Tuesday.   Nearly 7,000 MTA employees went out on strike at 12:01 a.m. Monday   after talks broke off between the agency and officials with the   Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents nearly 2,000 mechanics.   MTA officials want the ability to contract out some of the work   performed by the mechanics, including maintenance, and to buy some   equipment that is now made by its union workers.   The union opposes such moves, disputing MTA officials who say outside   contracting will save money.   Union and MTA negotiators were meeting again Tuesday night, but both   sides were careful not to characterize Tuesday's meeting as a   negotiating session.   ``We're meeting to decide whether we should reconvene negotiations,''   said MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene.   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS.)   The meeting was called by state mediator Tom McCarthy, who has been   involved with the negotiations for more than a month. AFL-CIO   Secretary-Treasurer Jim Wood also was scheduled to attend the meeting   at a downtown law office.   ``Obviously, we only have one thing to talk about and that's how to get   a speedy resolution to the strike,'' Wood said. ``We're trying to   explore what kind of opportunities there are to resolve this.''   But the president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing nearly   2,000 mechanics, said that he expects a long strike if the MTA pushes   for a new contract that allows the agency to contract out services to   other vendors.   ``I'm predicting a very long strike if subcontracting is the issue,''   ATU president Michael Bujosa said.   The unions representing the MTA's bus drivers and clerks have reached   agreements that call for wage increases of 4.6 percent over three   years, according to MTA officials. But both unions plan to continue to   honor the mechanics picket lines.   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, an MTA member,   said he is encouraged that the two sides are meeting, but that the ATU   contract has to be ``brought into the 21st century.''   He said the agency can save taxpayer dollars by contracting out some   services instead of manufacturing its own tools and equipment in-house.   ``Currently the union has a Santa's Village mentality,'' Antonovich   said.   He noted that it costs $9 to buy a commercial dust pan at a store and   $26 for the MTA workers to build one.   ``People got excited about a $900 toilet seat,'' Antonovich said.   ``Here they're making a $26 dust pan.''   But mechanics on the picket lines outside of the MTA's downtown   headquarters said that whenever the agency buys equipment from other   vendors it is usually poorer quality that costs more in the long-run   because it has to be replaced sooner.   Mechanic Sergio Diaz said the MTA used to spend $800 to buy power   steering boxes.   ``If you pay $800 for that and we're changing them like hot cakes, what   you'll find is that it's more expensive,'' Diaz said.   The picket lines were calm Tuesday. But there was one report of   violence when a replacement driver was treated for cuts he suffered   when a rock was thrown through a bus windshield on Broadway. The driver   was hit by glass but was not seriously hurt, Greene said.   Despite the injury, MTA chief executive Franklin White said the   agency's emergency strike plans went smoother in the second day. Five   buses were added to the fleet, which now numbers 318, compared with   regular peak service of 1,900 buses.   Authorities reported that ridership on the Metrolink commuter rail   system rose by 20 percent as a result of the strike, and that freeway   traffic appeared to be heavier than usual.   The agency is operating a total of 31 lines countywide instead of the   usual 204.   Although the lines are running along the heaviest traveled routes, they   are operating only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Ridership drops also were   reported on the Metro Red Line and Metro Blue Line because of the   shortened hours.

The EPA, in its monthly report to the cabinet, upgraded its assessment   of the economy in July, saying private-sector demand was showing \"a   firmer tone.\"   \"With improvements seen in manufacturing industries and corporate   capital investment, private demand is on its way to taking over the   role of leading the economic recovery from public demand,\" the EPA   said.   But the agency, whose report is regarded as the government\\'s official   verdict on the economy, called for continuation of an easy credit   stance to ensure suatainable, long-term recovery, as well as steps to   boost domestic demand and further structural reform.   \"The government should maintain the current easy monetary policy to   enhance and sustain the strength of the economic recovery and bring the   economy to a path of stable growth in the medium- and long-term,\" the   EPA said.   \"The government should also promote domestic demand expansion, the   resolution of bad debts problems at financial institutions, effective   use of land and deregulation and various other economic reforms,\" it   said.

       " 'training-2383': {'body': \"   complex battle of scientific experts.   The defense in such cases would typically want jurors who are not   experts at science and math, Troutwine said.   ``In general, when you have a jury that doesn't understand evidence,   they tend to throw that evidence out,'' he said. ``Often juries will   side with the expert who states his case the most clearly.''   But Brown said the defense might want smarter jurors if their DNA   expert is on strong ground.   Brown doesn't use consultants, but he said he led in designing the   questionnaire that he and McCaskill used this summer to select the jury   for Denver Blackwell.   McCaskill won a first-degree murder verdict, but Brown forced a plea   deal in which Blackwell escaped the death penalty.   As for the Rush Limbaugh supporters on that jury, Brown said: ``I'd   rather know they're there than get blindsided. I tried to get rid of   them.''   But no matter how much you learn about jury candidates, Brown said,   ``sometimes you have to go with a gut feeling.''   Patrick W. Peters put six persons on death row before he quit last year   as an assistant Jackson County prosecutor -- and he never used a   consultant.   ``I'd rather look somebody in the face and ask him a question than have   reams of demographic data,'' Peters said.   He joked with potential jurors during voir dire, and he preached the   importance of jury selection like a minister selling the Bible.   Peters wanted to establish intimacy and trust with each juror. Those   feelings should last through trial, he said, and peak in closing   statements.   Peters didn't ignore the so-called old truisms -- older juries are   better, college-educated juries are more liberal and rural juries are   more conservative. But he didn't cling to them.   ``Take a 55-year-old steelworker, a war veteran who has been the victim   of burglaries -- if I get the feeling he likes the defendant,   demographics be damned -- he's gone.''   The prosecutor also should use his voir dire questions to plant his   game plan in jurors' minds, Peters said. He would hint at that plan or   theme throughout trial and slam-dunk it home in closing statements.   In the Simpson case, for instance, Peters said prosecutors should work   on the concept that there is no perfect case. He said that's because   the defense ``will be holding up the standard of perfection.''   Defense lawyer Robert Beaird, who is listed in the Best Lawyers in   America, a peer-review book, also said he has no use for consultants.   ``When you start classifying people by categories,'' he said, ``you   make a mistake. They can't pick my friends for me. That's what I want   is 12 friends.   ``When you voir dire a jury, there is electricity, a contact with   people.''   Many lawyers and consultants try to make trials too technical, Beaird   said. ``A trial is no more complicated than selling a pair of shoes,''   he said.   ``You've got your version of events, and what you are doing is selling   that,'' Beaird said. ``Juries are not into technicalities. They're   looking for someone in that room to lead them through a mass of   evidence.   A decade ago, Beaird said, area prosecutors -- although none would   admit it -- routinely struck black people off juries. A stereotyping   that blacks were soft on criminals was the accepted wisdom then, he   said, a bit of so-called science that often helped the defense.   ``They'd strike all the blacks and leave on five white guys in   Harley-Davidson T-shirts, guys who would sympathize with me.''   Even with minorities on Simpson's jury, lawyers question whether it can   consist of the ideal ``fair cross-section.''   Beaird and Troutwine agree that the long Simpson trial -- expected to   last months -- could distort the jury pool. It might limit jurors, they   said, to people whose employers would pay them that long, or to the   retired or unemployed.   But the Superior Court judge on the case, Lance Ito, said this week   that he was pleasantly surprised at how many people want to be on the   jury.   He speculated as to why: ``It could be the hoopla factor.''\",\n",

Burstein, candidate for state attorney general, stretched out   her hand, but the man in the brown suit strode by without a smile.   ``You know, that's rude,'' Ms. Burstein said. She repeated: ``It is   rude.''   Another potential voter emerged from the Upper West Side subway station   with three unlit cigarettes sticking from his lips. ``All three you're   going to smoke?'' she asked. He did not look at her.   ``Would it hurt to shake a hand?'' she asked in mock exasperation,   smiling at yet another man. He also walked by. ``It apparently would.''   ``I've got to get these people better prepared as human beings,'' she   muttered finally after a tough half-hour of campaigning at 72d Street   and Broadway. ``As attorney general, I've got to do something about   this absence of civility,''   It was classic Karen Burstein: brash, funny and unconventional, a smart   skepticism combined with an abiding belief that government can make   people better. The subway campaign stop, a mainstay of politicians,   underscored something else that applies equally to her three opponents   in the Democratic primary next month: Ms. Burstein, 52, is relatively   unknown to the general public, even after 21 years in the Legislature,   as head of state and city agencies and as a Family Court judge.   But as the four candidates compete in an expensive and potentially   divisive dance of self-definition, Ms. Burstein is staking out ground   that some political analysts say puts her at an early, though   tentative, advantage. Among her opponents, G. Oliver Koppell, appointed   attorney general in December after the mid-term retirement of Robert   Abrams, is wrapping himself in his short incumbency and his party's   blessing. Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, is touting   his record as a prosecutor. Eliot L. Spitzer, a young former   prosecutor, is also running a law-and-order campaign with a touch of   anti-politician fervor.   But in addition to her claim that she has the widest experience, Ms.   Burstein has what some consider a biological edge this year: she is the   only woman running for a spot on a currently all-male Democratic   ticket. (The Republicans have two women running this year.) She is also   Jewish and is considered the most progressive candidate, in a primary   that traditionally has a heavy Jewish vote and usually attracts the   more liberal voters in the Democratic Party.   ``I would say she has got to be perceived as a very serious candidate,   and I bet Ollie Koppell doesn't sleep well at night thinking about   her,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who appointed Ms. Burstein as   the city's auditor general in 1987.   The race, however, has barely begun, and Ms. Burstein brings a bag of   potential weaknesses. She decided to run late, and fund raising has   admittedly been slow. She has virtually no establishment support. A   former Vietnam War protester and civil rights marcher, she is described   as impatient and intense, almost a caricature of an upstater's image of   New York City. Her slogan for her first political campaign, during the   Vietnam War, was: ``I'm 28, I'm running for Congress and I'm angrier   than you.''   ``She comes at you with the same intensity, whether it's to ask for a   cup of coffee or to get across some passion-felt position of hers,''   one political friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's   like she's running on all eight pistons at one time.'' Others say she   has mellowed with age.   She is a lesbian, a fact she has neither advertised nor concealed, but   that hangs as an unknown element in a campaign that may test the   state's prejudices and her opponents' restraint. With little fanfare,   she has asked for support from gay groups but has not promoted her   sexual orientation as a centerpiece of her campaign.   In an interview in her campaign offices, Ms. Burstein said her   qualifications and ideas -- her vision of law as ``a civilizing   principle'' for society -- are more relevant than her sexuality. But   she added that she believes it will be an issue, stated or not.   ``There are a couple of people for whom it will be like the excuse,''   she said. ``They didn't like me because I was a woman, they didn't like   me because I was Jewish, they didn't like me because I was too   liberal.''   She snapped her fingers, looking serious. ``It's easy,'' she said.   ``You know, I'm a lesbian.''   ``Frankly it's inexcusable that the state of New York hasn't elected a   woman statewide in 20 years,'' she said, referring to the 1974 election   of Mary Anne Krupsak as lieutenant governor. ``But do I intend to say,   `Hey, if you elect me I will be the first woman in 20 years, plus I   will be the first openly gay person?' No, but I don't really have much   choice about it. The truth of it is, the papers will say it.''\",\n",

       " 'training-2542': {'body': \"   The storage sheds were rented last fall in small Kansas towns. Two tons   of the type of fertilizer used in the federal building bombing were   bought about the same time. The diesel fuel was the finishing touch,   bought days before the blast that killed 167 people.   The anatomy of the federal building bombing was detailed in an FBI   affidavit unsealed Thursday at a hearing for Terry Nichols. He is   charged in the blast with his Army buddy Timothy McVeigh.   According to receipts found at Nichols' home in Herington, Kansas, a   storage shed was rented Sept. 22 in Herington in the name Shawn Rivers.   Eight days later, the receipts show that a Mike Havens bought a ton of   ammonium nitrate fertilizer at a farm supply store in McPherson,   Kansas, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Herington.   McVeigh's fingerprint was found on the receipt, the affidavit says, and   investigators say such fertilizer was used in the 4,800-pound   (2,175-kilogram) bomb.   On Oct. 17, another storage unit, known as No. 40, was rented to a Joe   Kyle in Council Grove, about 24 miles (39 kilometers) from Herington,   the affidavit says. The next day, a Mike Havens again bought another   ton of ammonium nitrate from the same farm supply store.   On Nov. 7, a third storage unit, No. 37, was rented in Council Grove,   this time in the name Ted Parker.   A few weeks later, according to the affidavit, Nichols wrote a letter   to McVeigh in which he said he planned to go to the Philippines.   McVeigh was to receive the letter only in the event of Nichols' death.   In that case, he should ``clear everything out of CG 37'' and   ``liquidate 40.''   Nichols also wrote that McVeigh would be on his own and should ``Go for   it!!''   The affidavit says ``CG 37'' refers to the Council Grove storage unit   No. 37 and that ``Liquidate 40'' refers to the storage unit No. 40,   both rented by Nichols.   Then, on April 15 and 16, Nichols purchased more than two dozen gallons   of diesel fuel from service stations in Manhattan and Junction City,   Kansas, the affidavit says.   The federal building was bombed the morning of April 19.   Nichols' appeared Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Ronald Howland in a   makeshift courtroom at the federal prison in El Reno, where McVeigh has   been held since being charged two days after the attack.   Nichols only spoke to answer the magistrate's questions, saying ``Yes,   your honor'' and ``Yes, sir.''   As the 10-page affidavit compiled by FBI Agent Henry Gibbons was   unsealed and the charges against Nichols were read, he sat slumped at   the defense table, shackled hand and foot. He stared straight ahead   when interim U.S. Attorney Patrick Ryan said Nichols faces the death   penalty if convicted.   According to the affidavit, Nichols waived his right to remain silent   after turning himself in. In the days after the bombing, he told the   FBI that he knows how to make a bomb by blending ammonium nitrate with   diesel fuel.   Nichols also gave agents permission to search his house. They found   detonator cord, blasting caps and several containers of ground ammonium   nitrate, which the affidavit said can be used to help boost a   fertilizer-fuel bomb.   He said he had picked McVeigh up in Oklahoma City on April 16 and   dropped him off in Junction City, the affidavit says. He said he met   McVeigh in Junction City on April 18 and loaned him his dark blue   pickup truck for about five hours.   The Ryder truck that carried the bomb was rented in Junction City on   April 17. The affidavit says a Ryder truck was seen behind Nichols'   house that day.   A senior federal official in Washington, who spoke on condition of   anonymity, told The Associated Press that Nichols admitted to the FBI   that he helped bring the Ryder truck to Oklahoma City.\",\n",

The group\\'s trade liberalisation schedule, tagged the Manila Action   Plan, commits APEC to free trade among developed members by 2010 and   2020 for the rest.   Following last-minute lobbying by US President Bill Clinton, the forum   approved a statement backing Washington\\'s proposal to eliminate   barriers to trade in high-tech goods by 2000, despite some misgivings.   \"The most concrete development to come out of the meeting may be the   leaders\\' call for all countries to push the global trade agenda forward   at a crucial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore next   month,\" said Laura Tingle, chief political correspondent of the   Australian daily, The Age.   Major Japanese newspapers urged APEC members to go beyond pledges.   \"We believe that many important issues have been left unresolved due to   conflicting interests among the group\\'s member economies,\" the Yomiuri   Shimbun said.   The Yomiuri was critical of \"some Southeast Asian nations\" as well as   the United States and Japan.   \"Some Southeast Asian nations, which have started to show signs of   cooling economies, were conspicuously lukewarm toward the   liberalization goal.   \"The United States was particularly enthusiastic over the idea of   promoting debate among members to conclude an agreement on information   technology, but otherwise its action plan lacked boldness.   \"Japan, for its part, failed to offer any fresh liberalization ideas,   with the possible exception of one regarding the extension of validity   dates for visas held by citizens of other APEC members,\" the Yomiuri   said.   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the action plans made by each APEC member   were \"only the first step.\"   The Jakarta Post warned the benefits of free trade will not be shared   equally. Stronger economies such as the United States and Japan will   certainly benefit more from APEC than a country such as Papua New   Guinea, it said.

Judicial sources have not confirmed that Marseiller has brought legal   action, nor given any indication what legal steps may next be taken.

Jewish organisations threatened a boycott of Swiss banks if Delamuraz   did not apologise, and the WJC had given the government four weeks to   distance itself from his comments.   The row was patched up however when Delamuraz apologized to WJC   president Edgar Bronfman in a letter dated Tuesday, saying that the   information on which he based his declarations was \"imprecise.\"   In a press briefing Wednesday, Delamuraz further apologized to Bronfman   for hurting his feelings and those of many others in the Jewish   community. \"I assure you that was not my intention.\"   Bronfman said in response: \"I look forward to returning to constructive   work together with the Swiss authorities and the Swiss banks, to   resolve outstanding questions which will further our goals of truth and   justice.\"   Jewish organizations have estimated at more than seven billion dollars   assets owned by victims of the Holocaust and not reclaimed from Swiss   banks.

No alleged planner or perpetrator of the slaughter of minority Tutsis   and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists in the wake of the death in a   plane crash of President Juvenal Habyarimana has yet been judged, to   the despair of victims' families.   However there are hopes of some progress by next month, as predicted by   President Pasteur Bizimungu and Richard Goldstone, chief prosecutor for   the international tribunal for Rwanda.   The tribunal was set up in November 1994 by the United Nations to judge   those allegedly responsible for acts of genocide or other serious   violations of human rights in Rwanda during 1994.   Given the scale of the atrocities and its own limited resources, the   tribunal only intends to try the top people behind the killings,   leaving it to Rwanda's courts to deal with the thousands of lesser   butchers.   The investigations are prolonged and costly, and the tribunal, based in   Arusha, Tanzania, has limited resources.   So far it has indicted only a handful of suspects, of whom only two or   three have been arrested in the countries where they fled.   But the present Tutsi-led government in Rwanda also wants to try the   leaders, and it has outdistanced the international tribunal by   demanding the extradition of 19 people from Cameroon, of whom 13 have   been arrested.   Goldstone is hoping for early consultations on their fate, and could   end up prosecuting some of them. He has noted that his court takes   supremacy over national jurisdictions.   Another suspect, Colonel Theoneste Bagosora, also tracked down to   Cameroon, has been sent to Belgium, which asked for his extradition   first for his alleged role in the murder of 10 Belgian UN peacekeepers.   Meanwhile nearly 70,000 Hutus are crammed into Rwandan jails awaiting   trial for their alleged role in the 1994 genocide. Many have been   imprisoned after denunciation for purely personal motives.   The trials by a judicial system which is only slowly beginning to   recover after being decimated by the killings and subsequent flight of   more than a million refugees.   But they are deemed essential if there is to be any sort of   reconciliation between Rwanda's ethnic groups.   Bizimungu said last week that no defendant would be sentenced to death   or life imprisonment.\",\n",

Report:   U.S. Coupon Wealth Largely Untapped   Despite the stagnating economy and the threat of inflation, Americans   continue to pay full price for such items as salad dressing,   conditioner, and laundry detergent. As a result, coupons cumulatively   worth over $5.3 billion go unredeemed, a statistic that \"concerned\" DCS   Secretary Edward Fellowes.   \"Personal savings are down in fiscal 2005, primarily because Americans   are unwilling to cash in on these amazing rebates,\" Fellowes said.   \"Simply purchasing any Boca-brand meatless product at a 75-cent   discount could spur vast growth in other key economic areas such as   cold-sore medication, halogen light bulbs, and the entire frozen-foods   sector.\"   Although these coupons can easily be found in flyers tucked between the   sections of a Sunday newspaper, in racks in front of retail stores, or   even on the ground, the report revealed that as many as seven in 10   Americans have not redeemed a coupon in two years.   In a time in which personal debt is at a record high, Fellowes said   that such financial lassitude is \"America\\'s shame.\"   \"Twenty years ago, a 50-cent coupon for Mazola corn oil produced runs   on supermarkets so large that rain checks had to be issued by the tens   of thousands,\" Fellowes said. \"Today, such a discount receives barely   an acknowledgment from the public. Even two-thirds of all issued rain   checks are unused.\"   The DCS report also connected the decline of take-home wages in the   past five years to the public\\'s reluctance to redeem a $1.50 rebate on   Duracell AA-sized batteries in the fall of 1999.   Enlarge Image Report: U.S. Coupon Wealth Largely Untapped   Coupon users in a Grand Forks, ND grocery store.   To raise more awareness of the potential savings bonanzas available,   the DCS has launched a campaign in which operatives hand coupons   directly to consumers, often right in front of the establishment where   they can be redeemed. The campaign, scheduled to last through the   holiday season, will cost taxpayers an estimated $10 million, but the   cost will be made up for as long as Americans use the coupons, Fellowes   said.   \"Brushing past the operatives or throwing their handouts in the trash   only hurts the American consumer in the long run,\" Fellowes said.   \"After all, 30 cents off Downy fabric softener is 30 cents toward a new   home.\"   Consumer advocacy groups such as the Foundation For Shoppers\\' Issues,   however, contend that when it comes to coupon use, too many   restrictions apply.   \"There\\'s a myriad of complications with coupon use,\" FSI spokesperson   Leslie Frye said. \"Certain coupons are not valid with other offers, and   participation among stores may vary. Also, if consumers do not hurry,   there is a significant risk that the coupons will reach their   expiration dates.\"   Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared to side with   the conclusions of the DCS report. A regular coupon clipper with a   Sam\\'s Club membership, Greenspan has warned against rash disregard of   coupon use for years. In a statement reacting to the report\\'s findings,   he said that unless Americans start becoming \"smart shoppers,\" families   and possibly the country at large will experience a sharp economic   downturn. He also called for retailers to offer more double-coupon   days, and for coupon-issuing businesses to improve perforation   standards, so coupons can be more easily separated from their   promotional materials without tearing.   \"Coupons need to be out of the kitchen drawer and into the cash   register if this economy has any chance of turning around,\" Greenspan   said. \"I\\'d also like to draw particular attention to the recent   two-for-$5 deal on all flavors of Doritos-brand chips,   buy-two-get-one-free deals on Wizard air fresheners, and, perhaps most   importantly, box-top proofs of purchase on many Betty Crocker products,   which, when redeemed, raise funds for schools nationwide.\"   \"Every little bit helps,\" Greenspan added.',\n",

       " 'training-2098': {'body': '   Leaders of Turkey\\'s ruling tripartite coalition held a meeting on   Monday in a last-ditch attempt to reach a consensus on a presidential   candidate who may garner support from the opposition parties as well.   According to the election procedure, the deadline for presidential   nominations expires at midnight Tuesday and the presidential elections   should be completed by May 15.   As the three leaders entered their fourth meeting in three weeks on the   presidency, it is believed that they have a dim chance of reaching an   agreement on a joint candidate and it is much more probable that each   party will nominate its own candidate.   In this case, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly (parliament)   Yildirim Akbulut, who is expected to announce his candidacy on Tuesday,   will have an increased chance of becoming the next president.   Four names have been mentioned for presidential candidates so far. In   their last tripartite meeting, Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader and   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit proposed DSP deputy and Foreign Minister   Ismail Cem or Professor Mehmet Haberal, dean of Baskent University, for   the presidency.   The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader and Deputy Prime Minister   Develet Bahceli proposed MHP deputy and Defense Minister Sabahattin   Cakmakoglu or Professor Kamil Turan, dean of the Law School in Gazi   University.   Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland Party (ANAP), however, refrained   from naming candidates during the meeting and reserved the right of   making an assessment of the issue with the ANAP executives.   It was expected that other names may appear on the agenda of Monday\\'s   meeting. After talking with his coalition partners, Ecevit will consult   the main opposition Virtue Party (FP) leader Recai Kutan and True Path   Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller.   During the past meetings, Ecevit asserted that none of the ruling   partners\\' leaders should be nominated as presidential candidates to   avoid potentially adverse impact on the stability of the coalition.   Neither Bahceli nor Yilmaz reacted to the statement, which was a clear   indication that Ecevit was not in favor of presidency for Yilmaz, who   has been eyeing for the position since the very beginning of his   joining in the coalition government as the junior partner.   The ANAP is still determined to nominate its leader as presidential   candidate. One ANAP executive member said that \"if no agreement is   reached in the summit, we will nominate Yilmaz as our candidate.\"   He predicted that Yilmaz would be the most likely candidate to assume   office, adding that those candidates suggested by Ecevit and Bahceli   will not even be able to garner votes from their own parties.   He said that Akbulut, also from ANAP, is the only candidate capable of   challenging Yilmaz for presidency. The speaker has reportedly affirmed   to Yilmaz that he will run for presidency.   Due to the souring relations between Yilmaz and Akbulut, it is believed   that Akbulut will not hesitate to challenge Yilmaz for office, even if   Yilmaz is nominated as a presidential candidate by ANAP.   The majority of deputies, regardless of their party background, are   strongly against the nomination of a candidate from outside the   parliament, therefore they give practically no chance to either   Professor Haberal or Professor Turan.   Although numerous public polls showed that Cem is the favorite, he   lacks support in parliament. Following a briefing on foreign relations   last week in parliament, Cem received staunch criticism from FP and DYP   deputies as well as from ANAP deputy Kamran Inan, chairman of the   Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission.   Cem\\'s biggest handicap is his being a member of a left-wing political   party in a parliament dominated by right-wing ideals. The coalition   partner MHP simply would not give the green light to Cem because he is   a leftist from ANAP.   For the same reason, it is believed that the opposition parties, the FP   and DYP, will also refrain from providing him any support. Under such   circumstances, it is expected that Cem will not receive support from   his own ANAP either.   Diplomatic circles here said that the MHP Defense Minister Cakmakoglu   might get some support from all the political parties other than the   DYP, though far from being adequate to carry him to the Presidential   Palace.   Other candidates, who officially nominated themselves for the   presidency, are DSP deputy Mail Buyukerman, ANAP deputy Agah Oktay   Guner and DSP deputy Oguz Aygun.   These candidates, who are devoid of any support and only came forward   to protest the attitude adopted by their leaders, have no chance of   winning the presidency at all, analysts said.',\n",

       " 'training-1712': {'body': \"   On the night when everyone who's anyone crowded into the chamber of the   House of Representatives for Bill Clinton's State of the Union address,   where was the second most important man in America?   Not behind him on the podium. Not among the Senate grandees, scowling   an ever-doleful scowl. And not in the balcony above, squeezed   uncomfortably (in every sense) between the first and the second ladies,   as he was two years ago.   No, Alan Greenspan was at home, nursing a cup of yogurt and watching   the whole affair on TV.   Normally, Greenspan's avoidance of the spotlight would seem in   character. The chairman of the Federal Reserve is, after all, a man who   has always seemed happiest when hidden in his marble sanctum.   Yet in the past few weeks, Greenspan has been playing an   uncharacteristically public role: volunteering a plan to slice the   federal deficit by cutting the yearly inflation-adjustments paid to   pensioners; lobbying Congress on behalf of the administration for its   Mexican bailout; and warning the new boys on Capitol Hill not to fiddle   the books in their crazed quest to cut taxes.   The new visibility is not so surprising. Greenspan is a Republican of   impeccable credentials: appointed by Ronald Reagan; a former employee   of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and, as one Reagan aide puts it, ``a   key player in more Republican presidential campaigns, platforms and   administrations than any other economist in the country.''   With his party in complete control of Congress for the first time in 40   years, Greenspan's influence is perhaps greater now than it ever has   been.   And yet, by an irony, the very realignment that has enhanced his power   may also turn out to make harder his main task: guiding a slowing   economy to a ``soft landing'' rather than a hard recession.   At the moment, of course, the economy is doing anything but slowing.   Last year output grew by 4 percent and is still surging ahead. The   unemployment rate fell by more than a full percentage point, to 5.5   percent (and to nearly 5 percent outside California).   Labor shortages are starting to crop up. So, too, are the faint signs   of incipient inflation, such as rising commodity prices.   And so when Greenspan convenes the meeting of the Federal Open-Market   Committee on Jan. 31, the chances are high that it will vote to put up   short-term rates.   If that happens, as looks likely, it will be the seventh such rate   increase in less than a year. So far the Clinton administration has   greeted the escalation with considerable stoicism: a sensible stance.   Before Greenspan began raising rates last February, he had not done so   for five years. Had the booming economy remained unrestrained through   1994, inflation would almost certainly have arrived already.   But now Greenspan faces a trickier task, both economically and   politically. Everyone knows last year's rate increases will slow the   economy. The question is when, and by how much.   Greenspan's own suspicions are not much more reliable than anyone   else's. But in pursuit of a soft landing, the chairman may well decide   that rates need to be hiked several times over the next few months.   David Hale of Kemper Financial Services is not alone in thinking that,   to slow growth to around 2.5 percent, the Fed could be forced to raise   short-term rates from 5.5 percent today to 8 percent by the end of the   year.   With the prospect of the Fed's actions hitting home as the 1996 primary   season gets under way, both Democrats and Republicans are getting ready   for a downturn.   Naturally, each side will blame the other. But both may attack the Fed   just as sharply.   In the White House, Clinton's tongue was long held by Lloyd Bentsen;   now the new treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, has that slippery job.   But other members of Clinton's economic team, and several of his   political advisers, are urging him to squeal if the Fed raises rates   again.   Republicans, too, are likely to attack Greenspan. Late last year Newt   Gingrich said he thought rising interest rates were ``a real problem''   and then backpedaled furiously. But he also suggested that the economy   could grow by as much as 5 percent without sparking inflation.   And James Saxton, a House Republican who is the new vice-chairman of   the joint economic committee, has already blamed the Fed in advance for   the recession he sees ahead.   Greenspan has been here before, standing up simultaneously to bullying   from both the White House and his fellow Republicans during George   Bush's tenure.   But this time something is different: both parties are pursuing   tax-cutting policies which are bound to make his job more difficult.   For whether or not Republicans come up on paper with the spending cuts   to offset their tax-chopping, investors will be suspicious that the   cuts are phony or temporary; that the tax reductions will prove more   costly than expected; and that the deficit will therefore balloon.   Such is the stuff that fuels inflationary expectations -- which   Greenspan would surely feel compelled to stamp down.   The chairman will no doubt be hoping that cooler heads prevail -- and   not just for the sake of the economy.   With his term due to run out in early 1996, he has been angling for   reappointment since Clinton arrived; cabinet officials report being   called repeatedly for breakfast and flattery from Greenspan.   The Republican takeover on Capitol Hill seemed to many within the   administration to seal the deal. Who else would so easily fly through   confirmation in the Senate?   If the economy crash-lands, however, so too may Greenspan's hopes of   another series of state of the unions spent at home by choice.\",\n",

       " 'training-1717': {'body': \"   ``The crisis fabricated by the Iraqi regime and its crazy leadership   has not affected us at all.'' So far, the bluff diagnosis of Sheikh Ali   Jaber al-Ali al-Sabah, a manager at Kuwait's national oil firm, has   been borne out by the behavior of oil traders.   Up a few cents one moment, down a few the next: the price of Brent   crude has never moved far above $17 a barrel.   In contrast, when Saddam Hussein last got belligerent, in 1990, the   price briefly spiked above $40 a barrel.   Still, anyone tempted to feel complacent should think twice. The main   reason why the market was unperturbed by 80,000 Iraqi troops marching   up and down Kuwait's border is that traders did not expect them to get   anywhere near the country's oil wells.   So far, everything -- from the West's rapid response, to the withdrawal   of Iraq's forces -- suggests the market is right to take a sanguine   view of Saddam's latest expedition.   But if Kuwait's oil production really were interrupted, the world will   find it far harder to cope now than it did in 1990.   Back then, economic growth was so feeble that higher oil prices were   enough to cause a fall in demand. Markets were so slack and Iraq so   broke that as long as Saudi Arabia was willing to push up its   production, the West could be confident it needed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil   less than Saddam Hussein needed western money.   Things are different now. Growth has recovered in America and Britain;   it is picking up in the rest of Europe; and even Japan's economy is   twitching again.   The International Energy Agency in Paris expects oil demand in the new   year to be almost 1 million barrels a day (b/d) higher than it was a   year earlier.   With Iraqi oil still kept off the market by the United Nations   sanctions, there is only 2-2.5 million b/d of spare OPEC capacity   outside Kuwait (3 percent of world demand), according to the Petroleum   Finance Company, which is based in Washington, D.C.   This would be barely enough to cover the loss of Kuwait's 1.85 million   b/d of production, especially as consumers tend to build up stocks at   the first whiff of shortage, pushing demand higher than it would   otherwise be.   In such a tight market, prices are sensitive to the slightest   interruption of supply. When Nigerian oil workers went on strike in the   summer, taking only 340,000 b/d out of production, the price of oil   shot up by more than $3 a barrel.   The same logic suggests that Iraq's return to international oil markets   will send prices lower.   As long as Iraq can reopen its export pipeline through Turkey and   protect it against attacks from Kurdish rebels, the country could   probably export 1 million b/d immediately, and double that within a   year, when its southern export terminals into the Gulf could be   working.   Even if the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council settle their   differences over Iraq's political obligations, this will continue to   divide them.   America wants to help its ally, Saudi Arabia, which would suffer from   Iraqi exports either through lower prices or through lost market share,   and probably both. That would be a reverse for a country with a large   budget deficit.   But France and Russia see it slightly differently. France's Total and   Elf, and a consortium of oil companies from Russia, including Lukoil   and Rozneftegazstroy, have separately managed to secure prize acreage   for producing Iraqi oil.   For them, the end of sanctions will mark the beginning of the real   excitement.\",\n",

Republican National Committee chief Haley Barbour recently said that if   President Bill Clinton were to win again, the last thing Republicans   want is for him to have a \"blank check\" to push his \"progressive\"   policies on US voters.   All opinion polls give Clinton what appears to be an insurmountable,   double-digit lead over his Republican rival Bob Dole, but provide no   clues as to whether the Democrats will regain the upper hand in   Congress, which they lost in the 1994 mid-term elections.   All 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 of the Senate\\'s   100 seats will be up for grabs Tuesday.   Control of Congress could prove crucial for Clinton, with a friendly   legislature affording the White House a less trying time during a   second term that already has an ominous look about it.   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott vowed the Republicans would   investigate Democratic fund-raising practices if they kept control of   the Senate.   \"There are big troubles ahead for this president,\" he warned.   The Clinton campaign has been dogged by a growing controversy over   large campaign donations linked to Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea   that broke just weeks before Tuesday\\'s presidential vote.

The padded, plastic breastplate covers the entire torso of Nebraska's   convalescent quarterback. Actually, he said he felt more like Robocop   than Madonna. And he's not looking to remain bulletproof Saturday   against Colorado, only to keep his lungs inflated.   Twice in this season of quarterback troubles at Nebraska, Berringer has   suffered a collapsed lung. Officially, it was called a partially   collapsed lung, but Berringer hinted that if a partially collapsed lung   hurt this bad, a fully collapsed lung must be as unbearable as a Senate   filibuster.   As everyone knows, Tommie Frazier, Nebraska's starting quarterback, is   out for the season after blot clots recurred in his right leg.   Berringer, his replacement, has been operating under the caution flag   for several weeks. While the rest of the Cornhuskers have been playing   tackle, Berringer has been restricted to a version of two-hand touch.   Hand off, roll out, don't get hit.   But, with the Big Eight title and a shot at the national championship   on the line, Berringer insists he has fully recovered. His lungs, like   a pair of steel-belted radials, are inflated to the proper pressure for   road testing. And Nebraska's option offense is ready to flower after   some necessary wilting during Berringer's recovery.   A victory over Colorado on Saturday in this matchup of undefeated teams   would put the Cornhuskers in good position to finish the season   unbeaten and take a shot at the national title in the Orange Bowl.   Their primary competition for the top spot would likely come from Penn   State, which plays at home against Ohio State Saturday and will try to   avenge a 24-6 loss to the Buckeyes last year on a wet day in Columbus,   Ohio.   The other big games will be played in Florida, where Duke puts its   unbeaten record to the test at Florida State, and Virginia Tech plays   at Miami.   Berringer, a junior from Goodland, Kan., is understandably sensitive   about news media suggestions that Nebraska's chances for a national   title flew South like a flock of geese when Frazier was sidelined. The   Cornhuskers are still undefeated at 8-0. Berringer has done what a   backup is supposed to do, hold to a charted course, keep wind in the   sails.   ``I don't have to play a phenomenal game for us to win,'' Berringer   said. ``I think our offensive line can dominate anybody. We've got a   great backfield and receivers. We're not preparing for this like we're   going to line up against some monster we can't compete with.''   Perhaps not. But Colorado (7-0) is the closest thing to Godzilla that   Nebraska will find terrorizing the Big Eight this season. The Buffaloes   rank No.2 nationally in total offense. Tailback Rashaan Salaam, the   reluctant Heisman Trophy candidate, is the nation's leading rusher   (179.4 yards per game) and scorer (15.4 points per game). And the team   trails an air of inevitability and invincibility after that storybook   desperation pass against Michigan.   If anyone has the antidote to Salaam, it may be Nebraska, whose   sophomore tailback, Lawrence Phillips of Los Angeles, ranks third among   the nation's rushers, averaging 154 yards per game. Lately, he has been   running between the tackles in Nebraska's remedial offense.   The hope this week is that, with Berringer healthy, Colorado won't be   able to stack its defense like poker chips in the middle, gambling that   Nebraska still won't run outside.   ``Brook is healthy, so we can put the rest of the offense in,''   Phillips said. ``This should open up the running lanes. We should be   able to pass and run the option.''   Left unsaid is that if Berringer's lung collapses again, it is likely   that Nebraska will, too. But at least no one is questioning his heart.   ``People have said the season's over, the national championship's   over,'' Berringer said, referring to Frazier's unavailability. ``That's   ridiculous. We haven't missed a beat.''\",\n",

Giving a 50-minute speech in parliament Thursday, Goh offered a   framework of wider cooperation between the two countries which would   help overcome existing difficulties in their relationship.   The recent dispute between Singapore and Malaysia was sparked by a   court statement by Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, which   refers to Johor, a state in southern Malaysia.   The Malaysian government decided on March 26, 1997 to temporarily   freeze its ties with Singapore and postpone all the ongoing bilateral   talks.   Despite Lee made a public apology for his statement, the Malaysian   government said that bilateral ties could not be improved in a short   period of time.   Goh hoped that Singapore and Malaysia would continue their talks over   mutually beneficial projects, such as a high-speed electric rail link   between the two countries and a long-term water supply deal from   Malaysia to Singapore.   Singapore relies heavily on water from Malaysia and the two agreements   on water supply will expire in 2010 and 2060.

Bush to \"boycott\" Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and rely   on other Palestinian leaders for peace negotiations.   After their fourth meeting since Bush took over the White House a year   ago, late on Thursday, the two leaders emerged with different views on   how the Middle East peace process should evolve.   For Sharon, Arafat \"is not and never will be a partner. He\\'s out of   play,\" The prime minister called for an \"alternative Palestinian   leadership.\"   Bush, on the other hand, agreed on keeping Arafat under pressure, but   stopped short of questioning his credentials as the representative of   the Palestinian people.   \"I assured the prime minister that we would continue to keep pressure   on Mr. Arafat to convince him that he must take serious, concrete, real   steps to reduce terrorist activities in the Middle East,\" Bush said   during a joint press conference after his meeting with Sharon.   Before the meeting, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush would   \"make clear that the United States will remain engaged in the region   and remain engaged with the Palestinian Authority\" headed by Arafat.   But Sharon repeated his views at a press conference after his meetings   with Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.   \"More pressure must be put on Arafat,\" he said, \"because it can   accelerate the emergence of an alternative leadership, because Arafat   is directly responsible for the suffering of the Palestinian   population.\"   \"This process will take a while, but the longer Yasser Arafat remains   out of play the quicker it will take,\" he stressed, suggesting that the   Palestinian leader should be circumvented.   \"It\\'s possible to speak with other Palestinians like I have done,\" said   Sharon, referring to his first meeting Wednesday with three top   Palestinian officials, including Palestine Legislative Council   president Ahmad Qorei and the PLO\\'s number two leader, Mahmud Abbas.   \"These Palestinians requested that I meet with them again on my return   from the United States,\" said Sharon, adding: \"I\\'ve accepted it as part   of the pressure that must be exerted on Arafat.\"   Sharon said Israel \"has no intention of getting physical with Yasser   Arafat,\" but stressed that the Israeli army would continue to keep   Arafat under virtual house arrest in the West Bank town of Ramallah,   where Israeli tanks surround his headquarters day and night.   On that issue, the prime minister said, \"there was no criticism from   the United States.\"   However, Israeli Defense Minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, who was also   visiting Washington Thursday, told reporters that Bush\\'s national   security adviser Condoleezza Rice had a different take on Arafat\\'s   confinement.   \"Rice believes that keeping Arafat in Ramallah could have the opposite   effect of strengthening rather than weakening him,\" Eliezer said.   The Israeli official, who also met here with Cheney and with Defense   Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, said he had \"warmly recommended the   Americans to focus all their efforts in establishing a dialogue with a   group of Palestinians in Arafat\\'s entourage.\"   \"Only Arafat can fight (against terrorism),\" Eliezer said, \"but he   doesn\\'t want to, while other political officials would like to, but   can\\'t.

The pope is a far cry from the robust 58-year-old Polish cardinal who   was chosen to head the church 17 years ago. He has never recovered   fully from a May 13, 1981 assassination attempt. A viral infection,   probably contracted during one of numerous blood transfusions, makes   his left hand tremble, sometimes violently.   And he is still being treated for a benign intestinal tumor for which   he underwent surgery in July 1992. The pope also dislocated a shoulder   in 1993.   The pope began looking extremely frail after he broke his thigh   slipping in his bathroom in April 1994. He has abandoned the practice   of kneeling down and kissing the ground on arrival in a new country but   instead a bowl containing the local soil is held up for him to kiss.   Pope John Paul II was also forced to cut short his traditional   Christmas blessing last year, but doctors later said he only had   influenza and soon recovered.   Part of the pontiff's mission in Guatemala is to reinforce the   influence of his church in a country where evangelical Protestant   missionaries have made dramatic inroads in the past 25 years.

       " 'training-2362': {'body': \"   reform By Clyde Graham HALIFAX (CP) _ Leaders of the seven top industrial   countries set aside fresh concerns about Bosnia to reform the world   financial sys?V? 9?prevent another Mexico-type currency crisis that boosted   interest rates. ``We got a lot of business done,'' Prime Minister Jean   Chretien said Friday as he summarized progress at the annual G-7 summit,   dominated so far by rising conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. An expected   deal emerged to keep a closer watch on potential deadbeat countries and   bail them out if necessary. Chretien linked it all to the global concern   about unemployment _ little more than a side dish at this summit. ``The   concrete result of this meeting will help the world to feel that the world   is still growing and that growth will necessarily create jobs,'' said   Chretien. The leaders agreed on reform of the International Monetary Fund _   the world's central bank _ in the hope of heading off another   Mexican-peso-type crisis that jacked up interest rates across North America   this winter.  ``You know we have been concerned with the instability that   can be caused by volatile currency markets and large flows of capital,'' he   said after meetings in a downtown office building. ``That is why we have   agreed to strengthen the International Monetary Fund.'' With conflict   rising in Bosnia, the United States, Britain and France also launched an   urgent, worldwide search for contributions to finance an expanded UN   peacekeeping force. The call for peacekeeping funds, prompted by Congress's   reluctance to pay, is expected to concentrate on wealthy Persian Gulf oil   states and prosperous nations in Asia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin   arrived Friday to meet with his counterparts over dinner. The G-7 leaders _   from Canada, the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Germany and Japan _   are ready to chide Yeltsin for Moscow's crackdown in the breakaway republic   of Chechnya. But they'll also be asking for help in defusing the crisis in   Bosnia, where 11 of about 2,000 Canadian peacekeepers in the region are   being held hostage.  The leaders have also agreed on the need for better   and more open economic statistics as a kind of early-warning system for   troubled countries. ``The IMF must also be able to move faster when a   crisis does develop and it must have the necessary financial resources,''   Chretien said. He confirmed that will mean a doubling of money available to   the IMF. Some U.S. estimates have put the new total at $58 billion US,   while Canadians say the new figure will be closer to $43 billion US,   depending on how the value of various currencies is calculated. More   countries would kick into the fund to increase the total, while Canada's   share would not rise. That ``emergency financing mechanism'' could bail out   countries when the alarm bells fail to ring.  Chretien also said the G-7   leaders have agreed to reform the World Bank _ the sister institution of   the IMF _ and United Nations development agencies that aid poorer   countries. He also said French President Jacques Chirac has agreed to hold   an additional jobs summit next year.  France will follow Canada as host of   the annual G-7 economic meeting in 1996 at Lyon. Chretien said jobs and   growth will come from more open trade and that means a fully functioning   World Trade Organization, or WTO, launched this year. ``We want the WTO to   succeed.'' Chretien said the leaders have promised to establish an   effective way to settle trade disputes under the WTO. A bitter U.S.-Japan   fight over auto trade has been looming over the summit. Canada has been   pushing to make sure that dispute is handled by the new WTO.\",\n",

Nine other passengers and crew were still believed aboard the Yak-40   plane, blocked on a runway by interior ministry special forces at an   airport in the Caspian republic of Dagestan, although there was   confusion about the exact number of remaining prisoners.   Russian officials were negotiating with the hijackers, who had earlier   threatened to blow up the airliner unless they were paid two million   dollars and given enough fuel to fly to Iran.   Five passengers and a crew member jumped from the plane as a package   containing the money was handed over to the kidnappers, police said.   The exact number of hostages was unclear. Earlier in Moscow, interior   ministry spokesman Alexei Petrenko told AFP that 12 hostages, nine   passengers and three crew members were still on board the plane   Wednesday morning.   On Tuesday night, a quarter of an hour into a flight to Rostov, two men   aged 22 and 30 armed with at least one grenade forced the plane to   return to the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the tiny Russian   republic on the western shore of the Caspian.   The hijackers threatened to blow up the plane but let one deadline   pass. They demanded two million dollars and enough fuel to fly to Iran.   On Wednesday afternoon two trucks were parked near the plane, one of   which contained the jet fuel.   One of the hijackers was seen holding a package he said contained a   bomb while the other was brandishing a knife.   About 30 people were thought to have been on board the flight. The   hijackers began releasing them during the night.   The hijacking is the fifth in a series in the volatile Caucasus region.   The last, on July 28, ended in a bloodbath when five hostages and a   hijacker were killed after security forces stormed the plane.   The interior ministry spokesman said that members of the hijackers\\'   families were expected to arrive at the airport later in the day. It   was hoped they could persuade the men to surrender.   The Russian ambassador in Iran has requested Tehran\\'s permission to let   the airliner fly into its airspace if necessary, but no reply has yet   been received and the Russians fear the request will be turned down,   the agency ITAR-TASS reported.   In Tehran, the Iranian foreign ministry said for its part that Iran   would \"spare no effort\" in trying to solve the problem \"in case a   request is made by Russia.\"   A ministry spokesman, Mahud Mohammadi, told IRNA news agency that Iran   was \"deeply concerned about the safety of the passengers on board.\"   In the last hijacking, five hostages, four women and a girl, and a   hijacker were killed when security forces stormed the plane. Six other   hostages and five of the security forces were injured.   The three surviving hijackers have been sentenced to death.   The four who seized the aircraft at Mineralnye Vodi in southern Russia   near the Moslem republic of Chechnya had demanded 15 million dollars   ransom.   The storming of that plane was a departure from the previous Russian   stance of persuasion and negotiation during three other hijackings in   the Caucasus on December 23, 1993, and May 26 and June 28 of this year.',\n",

The European Union said Tuesday it had decided against joining the   embargo in favor of a ``critical political dialogue'' with Iran.   Other nations, including Turkey, also rejected the embargo, although   Japan said it postponed a dlrs 540 million loan to Iran.   The Clinton administration this week prohibited trade with Iran by U.S.   firms and their subsidiaries abroad in an attempt to stifle Tehran's   alleged sponsorship of international terrorism and its pursuit of   nuclear weaponry.   ``We presume that some of the European countries will agree and others   will not,'' U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said after meeting   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ``Nevertheless, we are going to keep   pressing our case.''   Albright arrived in the Middle East on Monday and held talks with   Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian leaders. Her discussions with   Mubarak focused on the Iranian embargo, sanctions against Iraq and the   renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.   At the news conference Wednesday, Albright said isolating Iran was the   best way to support the Middle East peace process, promote stability in   the region and curb international terrorism.   ``We do see them as most extreme,'' she said of Iran. ``We therefore do   believe that taking this kind of action to isolate what Secretary (of   State Warren) Christopher has called an outlaw regime is the   appropriate way to proceed.''   Critics have complained that severing trade and economic ties with Iran   will cost thousands of U.S. jobs. The lack of European support also   will hamper the embargo's effectiveness.   Meanwhile, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said   Wednesday he was ``deeply happy'' about the embargo, predicting it   would strengthen his country's resolve in the face of adversity.   ``This new action by the American government will increase the spirit   of work, happiness, effort and production among the revolutionary   people of Iran,'' state-run Iranian radio quoted Khamenei as saying.\",\n",

After posting growth of 8.2 percent in 1996, Malaysia\\'s focus in its   10th boom year would be on channelling bank lending to more productive   sectors and strengthening financial infrastructure, Bank Negara said.   The current account deficit narrowed to 13 billion ringgit (5.2 billion   dollars) last year but was expected to rise to 14.8 billion ringgit in   1997 as higher investment activity forced up imports, the bank\\'s 1996   annual report said.   The deficit included remittances by an estimated two million foreign   workers in the labour-starved country of 22 million people.   \"The prospects for 1997 remain favourable. However, the persistence of   several potential sources of inflationary pressures would call for   continued caution,\" Bank Negara\\'s governor Ahmad Mohamad Don said in   the report.   \"Higher domestic demand, continuing wage pressures in a tight labour   market, strong food prices and prevailing cost pressures\" are expected   this year, Ahmad said.   He said the central bank\\'s monetary policy will remain \"one of   restraint, with the focus on the management of liquidity to contain   excess demand and inflationary pressures,\" but tailored to changing   circumstances.   Consumer price inflation is projected to rise to 3.7 percent this year   from 3.5 percent in 1996.   Bank Negara\\'s growth forecast took into account \"downside   uncertainties\" including the strength and speed of the recovery in the   global electronics industry and the ability of exporters to maintain   competitiveness in export markets for electrical products.   The bank said it was insulating the economy to deal with potential   risks that may derail growth and to reduce vulnerability to external   factors.   Analysts said the growth range was within expectations but could   indicate that Bank Negara may introduce tightening measures for part of   the property sector.   Bank Negara singled out asset price inflation as a major worry,   attributing it to \"rising income, the wealth effect of a buoyant stock   market and excessive loan exposure to the property sector and lending   for speculative activities.\"   It warned that \"sectoral policies\" may be implemented to curb   over-exposure in bank lending towards the property and stock markets if   a tight monetary policy alone was insufficient to curb credit for such   activities.   Banking loans rose 27.6 percent to 319 billion ringgit last year. A   considerable portion of it went to the broad property sector,   consumption, investment, and shares.   The bank said the interest rate differential in relation to the United   States was not likely to widen.   This indicated that domestic interest rates were likely to remain firm   for the rest of the year in line with the upward trend in the US cycle,   economists said.   Bank Negara\\'s reserves at the end of 1996 were up 6.2 billion ringgit   to 87.86 billion ringgit, sufficient to finance about four months of   retained imports.',\n",

Numerous buildings in the breakaway republic's capital, including   parliament headquarters, were ablaze after Russian ground troops surged   into the city Saturday backed by heavy artillery and rocket fire.   By the time New Year's Day had arrived, the Russians claimed to control   the railway station and many of the rebel government's buildings in   Grozny. They said they were not storming the city but merely moving to   disarm Chechen fighters and restore order.   The Chechens, however, said they had repelled what they described as an   attempt to storm their capital by dozens of tanks and tens of thousands   of troops. They said they had captured many soldiers.   ``After fighting in Grozny, the Russian formations have been driven   out,'' spokesman Mavlodi Udugov declared in a frantic tone on Chechen   television Saturday night.   Even by daylight, it was hard to discern which side controlled what   areas after a day of carnage in the Grozny area. An inky black smoke   from fires at the Lenin oil refinery and elsewhere turned the ravaged   city as black as night.   A group of liberal Russian lawmakers visiting Grozny went on Chechen TV   Saturday night and urged President Boris Yeltsin: ``Stop the   bloodshed.''   But there was no immediate response from the Kremlin, nor was there   likely to be. Yeltsin chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, said Friday that   it was too late for a nonviolent situation, and the thunder of bombing   could be heard hours after the lawmakers' appeal.   In his televised New Year's Eve address, Yeltsin mentioned Chechnya   only briefly.   ``For myself, there is no greater task in the next year than to restore   peace and normal life in the republic of Chechnya, in North Ossetia and   Ingushetia. Then refugees can return to their own homes. For this, we   shall spare no effort.''   The Chechen president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, meanwhile was as defiant as   ever in his holiday message.   ``Despite the great might of the Russian army which is attacking   Grozny, the people of Chechnya have already won a moral victory,''   Dudayev said in an address to the people of Chechnya and Russia,   according to the Interfax news agency.   Yeltsin sent an estimated 40,000 soldiers into Chechnya on Dec. 11, to   restore it to the Russian federation and end what he calls an   illegitimate, criminal regime.   Hundreds of soldiers and civilians on both sides are believed to have   been killed. Televised footage of the carnage has stirred increasing   unease in Russia and abroad.\",\n",

Rose is scheduled to meet Bosnian army commander General Rasim Delic   and Serb counterpart Ratko Mladic at Sarajevo airport, although UN   sources warned it was possible the two sides could send lower ranking   representatives.   The meeting comes as a UN-brokered cessation of hostilies accord is   under severe strain, with both warring armies having recently advanced   their frontlines in two different sectors of the war.   Retaliatory Serb shelling into Bihac town last weekend killed seven   people while here in Sarajevo a youth was shot and wounded Tuesday by   sniper fire, which according to the United Nations appeared to come   from Serb lines.   Elsewhere in the Bihac pocket, located in northwestern Bosnia, the   government army is battling dissident Moslems and rebel Serbs from   neighboring Croatia. The latter two parties are not signatories to the   four-month truce and UN negotiators have made little headway persuading   them to at least respect the spirit of the accord.   UN military sources said early Thursday that more than 100 detonations   had been recorded in the Bihac region in the previous 24 hours.   In Sarajevo, UN officials have been hampered by delays in a Bosnian   army pullout from a demilitarized zone on Mount Igman and the failure   of the parties to agree on reopening critical supply and escape routes   for this war-weary capital.   UN inspection teams on Tuesday determined that mainly Moslem Bosnian   troops had left the zone -- in compliance with the ceasefire but nearly   two weeks after they had pledged to evacuate the sector.   When the United Nations tried to arrange a reconnaissance flight on   Wednesday with officers from both sides, in a bid to verify to   everyone\\'s satisfaction that the DMZ was clear, the mission had to be   cancelled when the Serbs demanded that positions outside the zone also   be inspected.   Of more immediate concern to the people of Sarajevo is the lingering   conflict over the type of humanitarian traffic to be allowed on roads   running south of here that link the capital to the outside world.   The routes, closed since July, were to be reopened under the ceasefire.   But while the Serbs are insisting that use be restricted to eight   UN-related agencies, the government is demanding authorization for   commercial trucks carrying food and other essential items.   Rose, whose one-year mandate here ends on January 24, characterizes   such snags as \"minor problems\" when compared to the violence that   prevailed before the truce.',\n",

Two goals in two minutes by Thierry Henry and Ray Parlour gained   Arsenal a 2-1 win after last season's runner up, Valencia, had gone   ahead at Highbury.   Roberto Ayala gave Valencia the lead with a goal four minutes before   the interval before strikes by Henry and Parlour in the 58th and 60th   minutes turned the game Arsenal's way. Arsene Wenger 's team now goes   to Spain in two weeks time with a slim lead while the Spanish team has   the satisfaction of an away goal.   Dennis Bergkamp, who rarely plays in Arsenal's games abroad because of   his fear of flying, missed the game because of an Achilles tendon   injury but the Gunners otherwise had a full strength lineup with   Nigerian striker Kwankwo Kanu and Thierry Henry in attack.   French midfielder Patrick Vieira should have put the Gunners ahead in   the 15th minute when, from barely two meters out, he headed against the   crossbar from a left wing corner. A follow up shot from countryman   Henry was blocked by a defender and Valencia survived.   The Spaniards went close when Ayala headed wide from Gaizka Mendieta's   right wing corner and, when Argentina forward Kily Gonzalez broke down   the left, his deflected cross beat Seaman but Juan Sanchez could only   fire into the side of the net at the far post.   Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares saved an Henry free kick at the   foot of the post but Arsenal's veteran England goalkeeper David Seaman   kept out efforts from Mendieta and John Carew.   Seaman made another block from Carew in the 36th minute with the   striker's follow up shot hitting the post before he was beaten four   minutes before half time.   Kily Gonzalez floated a pass out to Mendieta on the right and his cross   caused chaos in the Arsenal defense. The ball came clear to Ayala who   fired past Seaman from close range.   Goalscorer Ayala was unlucky when he appeared to get a yellow card   which would rule him out of the second leg in Valencia when the foul on   Kanu was clearly by Jocelyn Angloma.   Arsenal turned the game around with two goals in two minutes.   The equalizer came when Kanu failed to control Sylvain Wiltord' s left   wing free kick but the ball rolled to Robert Pires. His deft backheel   beat the offside trap and Henry was well placed to fire past Canizares.   Two minutes later Parlour won the ball in midfield and ran forward   barely a few yards before launching a 30-meter drive that flew past   Canizares into the roof of the net.   Leeds United staked their claim to a place in the Champions League   semifinals with a 3-0 victory over Deportivo Coruna.   Ian Harte drilled a free-kick past Francisco Molina in the 26th minute   for a stunning opening goal in the quarter-final first leg tie at   Elland Road.   Leeds dominated the first half and picked up where they left off in the   second with Alan Smith's close range header from Harte' s cross   powering past Molina in the 51st minute.   Rio Ferdinand gave Leeds a first leg lead they would expect to defend   comfortably in Spain in a fortnight's time with a 66th minute header   after Molina was caught in no-man's land at a corner.\",\n",

So far the effort has failed to turn up the alleged mastermind of the   September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.   \"It\\'s a huge area you try to patrol,\" Pentagon spokesman Richard McGraw   said Wednesday. \"So you use whatever intelligence means that you have,   including unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites and assets on the   ground, and reconnaissance airplanes -- every asset at your disposal   ...\"   McGraw declined to confirm that air surveillance was taking place over   areas of Pakistan adjoining Afghanistan, and that US Special Forces   were already operating there, though experts said it was a near   certainty that this was indeed happening.   US warplanes were still conducting raids over Afghanistan but were   returning to base with their bombs unused because of an absence of   targets, the Pentagon said. These operations will carry on as warplanes   seek out targets of opportunity and unmanned spy planes continue to   gather intelligence, officials insisted.   The United States has deployed unmanned Predator and Global Hawk drones   to gather intelligence over Afghanistan. They have been joined by RC-35   and F-14/SR3 reconnaissance planes and probably high-altitude U-2   aircraft, according to experts.   With the Taliban dispersed and al-Qaeda on the run, photographic and   videotaped intelligence-gathering is less important but remains useful,   as does intercepting radio traffic, according to military analyst   Daniel Goure of the Lexington Institute.   A radio intercept recently placed bin Laden in Tora Bora, in eastern   Afghanistan, but since then no further radio traffic has been detected   from him and al-Qaeda radio traffic has greatly diminished.   Thus, the eyes and ears of US and allied forces on the ground have   gained significance in the intelligence effort.

Five of those are non-Afghan citizens -- including John Walker, the   American Taliban fighter, as well as an Australian and, according to US   press reports, a Saudi worker for the Muslim humanitarian group Wafa.   Washington has also used money and other resources as   intelligence-gathering tools, offering a reward of 25 million dollars   for information leading to bin Laden\\'s capture.

However, the outcome of the meet, the   first in nearly three months punctuated by a bitter war of words, was   not immediately known.   The meeting went ahead despite Saturday\\'s killing of two soldiers and   came just nine days before a deadline set by the guerrillas for the   government to meet their economic demands.   The Tigers pushed back their original March 28 deadline after President   Kumaratunga announced that she was willing to consider lifting the ban   on diesel and gasoline imposed on LTTE-held territory.   Earlier, defence officials said they expected the government delegation   to take up with the LTTE the killing of the two soldiers outside the   sprawling Palaly military complex located inside the Jaffna peninsula.   The LTTE has denied responsibility for the killing which marked the   first army casualties since the truce went into effect on January 8,   shortly before Pope John Paul II visited Sri Lanka.   Bishop Fernando and two academics in the official delegation -- Charles   Abeysekara and Jayadeva Uyangoda -- had travelled to Jaffna in recent   weeks for unofficial talks with the Tigers as part of a private peace   initiative.   More than 30,000 people have died in bitter fighting since the LTTE   launched a separatist campaign in 1972 for the two million Tamil   minority concentrated in northern and eastern regions in this majority   Sinhalese republic.

The group of some 20 men, some of whom were amputees, shouted slogans   denouncing last year\\'s decision by the French privatization commission   to reject a bid by Daewoo Electronics to take over Thomson Multimedia.   They waved canes, tussled with security guards and prevented an embassy   car carrying Paye and ambassador Domninique Perreau from entering the   mission, the sources said.   Paye and Perreau had to enter the embassy on foot and then leave again   on foot so that Paye could make appointments with top South Korean   ministers.   \"The special French envoy should have been kicked out the minute he set   foot at Kimpo Airport,\" the protestors said in a manifesto handed over   to embassy officials.   The main purpose of Paye\\'s three-day visit to South Korea, where he is   scheduled to meet President Kim Young-Sam on Tuesday, is to explain to   Seoul the relations between his government and the privatization   commission which rejected the Daewoo bid.   The decision triggered an outcry in South Korea with some MP\\'s   suggesting that the decision had been racist, and others demanding that   the government review French contracts in South Korea.   South Korean police were not in evidence at the demonstration,   apparently preoccupied with massive strikes against a new South Korean   labor law.   In the manifesto the group said: \"France received great benefit from   South Korea when it was selected as the main contractor for the the TGV   (Train a grande vitesse -- the 2.1 billion dollar high speed train   contract won by GEC-Alsthom in 1994). But the French government   returned the favor with a total ignorance of our people.\"   \"Our government should take punitive measures by cancelling the   contract of the TGV, which has showed some malfuntioning in Europe   because of the cold,\" it said, adding a call for a boycott of French   goods.

Speaking at the National Assembly in central town of Dodoma, Mramba   said that although Tanzania succeeded to bring down inflation to 5.1   per cent by March, the rate is still too high compared with other   countries.   The crisis in Zanzibar between the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and   the main opposition Civic United Front over the elections has led to   some 30 deaths.   \"This also affected the value of the shilling,\" he said, adding that   the Bank of Tanzania (central bank) is taking actions to boost the   economy and make the changes of the currency\\'s value in a bid to tally   with economic fundamentals.   The Tanzanian shilling has come under intense pressure against the U.S.   dollar, depreciating from about 800 in early March to 890 in late June   this year.   Experts were quoted as saying that unless the Bank of Tanzania   intervenes in the market, the shilling will continue its slide.   They believed that the shilling has been overvalued for some time and   the depreciation is a market correction.   Depreciation of the shilling helps Tanzanian exporters, but is a major   blow to importers.   The depreciation could also have a negative impact on inflation figures   for the second and third quarter of this year, experts predicted.',\n",

       " 'training-1533': {'body': \"   In a major boost for worldwide nuclear arms reduction efforts,   Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved the long-stalled nuclear   Non-Proliferation Treaty.   The vote, which carried 301-8 with 20 abstentions, followed months of   intense diplomatic lobbying by the international community,   particularly the United States. It is a significant step in   strengthening ties between the West and Ukraine, the world's   third-largest nuclear power.   ``By this action, we have proved our intention to proceed toward   complete nuclear disarmament,'' said Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of   the main nationalist party Rukh.   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and around 1,800   nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.   Although Ukraine has begun dismantling a significant number of its   intercontinental missiles as part of a U.S.-funded three-way agreement   among Washington, Moscow and Kiev, it had hesitated in ratifying the   Non-Proliferation Treaty.   Officials had cited insufficient financial compensation and a lack of   security guarantees from Russia and other states.   ``Obstacles halting accession to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty   have been overcome,'' Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told   legislators Wednesday.   He said satisfactory guarantees in the form of a multinational   memorandum signed by the United States, Britain and Russia had, after   months of negotiations, been received just hours earlier. A similar   security assurance will be issued by France, Udovenko assured   legislators.   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for Ukrainian   diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He stressed that they included   assurances against Ukraine being attacked by both nuclear and   conventional weapons together with substantial financial support from   the West.   President Leonid Kuchma, elected last July, has staked a great deal of   his political credibility on steering the treaty through an often   recalcitrant parliament.   The former missile plant director has portrayed possession of the   weapons, which Ukraine has no capability to launch, as a profound   liability.   ``Experts estimate it will cost 10 billion to 30 billion dollars a year   to keep nuclear weapons,'' Kuchma told legislators. ``It means we have   to sell all our possessions to keep them.''   ``Delay (in approval) will only jeopardize our nation's sovereignty and   security,'' he said.   Both President Leonid Kuchma and the United States were pushing for the   treaty to be accepted by legislators before his state visit to   Washington next week.   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic of 52   million people to attain nuclear-free status by about the turn of the   century.   Washington has strongly backed Ukraine's new economic reforms under   Kuchma this year, spurring Kiev to proceed with its denuclearization   program.   Around dlrs 350 million of dlrs 700 million in U.S. aid for Ukraine in   1994 was targeted at dismantling Ukraine's nuclear stockpile.   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as ``a   major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed by the   new nations.''   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S. export   restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic equipment and   remove a Russian condition for its implementation of the START-1   treaty.   Ukraine's formal signing of the treaty will take place Dec. 5 or 6 at a   meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Budapest,   Hungary, Kuchma said.\",\n",

It was the first time Israel went on the record concerning a timetable   for a troop withdrawal from the Golan, captured from Syria in the 1967   Mideast war.   ``Eighteen months is what the Syrians are recommending and we are   suggesting four years,'' Peres told the U.S. television network PBS.   Portions of the interview were aired by Israel radio.   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was not clear whether   Israel has already proposed the four-year pullout to Syria or whether   Peres was ``saying this to create some momentum in negotiations.''   In the past, Israel proposed a withdrawal taking up to eight years,   said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Syria has objected to a lengthy withdrawal and hasn't committed itself   in public to the 18-month pullout mentioned by Peres.   Syria demands that in exchange for peace, Israel give back all of the   plateau overlooking northern Israel.   Israel has never said publicly how far it is willing to withdraw. But   in far-reaching statements in the past few days, Peres has said the   Golan was Syrian territory and that Israel would have to give back the   heights if it wanted to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle   East.   In the PBS interview, Peres also said the withdrawal was just one of   several issues being negotiated. The two sides are also talking about   the nature of peace offered by Syria and security arrangements after a   troop pullout.   Israeli-Syrian peace talks began in 1991, but there was no progress   until earlier this month, when the two sides reached agreement on broad   outlines for security arrangements.   Israeli and Syrian military officers are expected to resume talks in   mid-June in Washington.   Dennis Ross, Washington's Middle East coordinator, was expected in the   region by Sunday, to be followed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren   Christopher next week.   Christopher is expected to help prepare the agenda for the officers'   talks, the Israeli Foreign Ministry official said.   Meanwhile, an Israeli Justice Ministry team has been given until Aug.   31 to draft a bill for a national referendum on a peace treaty with   Syria, including a Golan withdrawal, ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed   said.   The team, headed by Assistant Attorney General Shlomo Goberman, was   appointed on Sunday.   The bill would provide a legal basis for a referendum. Israel never   held a plebiscite.   However, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has promised Israelis a   referendum to counter arguments by his hawkish opponents who claim he   does not have majority backing for a land-for-peace deal. af-kl\",\n",

For the fast-rising billionaire politician, analysts said now the   problem is not if he can take the premiership, but how to deal with his   personal legal problem and the mammoth task to save the country\\'s   stagnant economy.   In the short term, Thaksin\\'s future as prime minister hinges on the   country\\'s Constitution Court, which will give a final verdict over his   asset case within three months.   Last month, the National Counter Corruption Commission ruled that   Thaksin intentionally concealed his assets when he served as a deputy   premier in a previous cabinet in 1997.   If the Constitution Court upholds the ruling, Thaksin will be thrown   out of office and barred from politics for five years.   The court said after seeing an obvious election victory for Thaksin   that it will adhere to principles of law in handling the case, and will   not bow to any pressure even if Thaksin will be given the top job in   the next government.   The same criteria as used in considering the case against Sanan   Kachornprasart, former secretary-general of the ruling Democrat Party,   will apply on Thaksin. Sanan was finally convicted by the court on an   asset case and banned from entering politics for five years.   \"If the court convicts Thaksin, a Thai Rak Thai-led cabinet\\'s stability   will be in danger,\" Sanan commented on Sunday.   For sure, Thaksin\\'s conviction will lead to a chaos in his government   even the whole country, analysts said.   If surviving the case, he will still find it difficult to fulfill his   campaigning promises to raise the living standard of poor people and   pull the country out of current economic stagnancy.   While the central bank of Thailand predicted the economy will expand by   4 percent this year, most analysts gave their pessimistic views.   Experts of the ING Barings Bank have even warned the kingdom would face   a recession if the global economy slows down and domestic consumption   remains sluggish.   Economic woes have long been the headache of the current premier Chuan   Leekpai, who is furiously blamed by Thaksin for the slow pace of   economic recovery since he took office amid the depths of economic   crisis in 1997.   However, the headache will soon be Thaksin\\'s if he replaces Chuan in   one or two months\\' time as expected. And he must do better than Chuan   if he wants to keep the trust of the people, analysts said.   Chulakorn Singhakowin, chairman of the Thai Bankers\\' Association said   at a press conference today that he had heard some negative comments   from foreign investors, who showed little confidence in the new   government to steer the country\\'s economy toward sustainable recovery.   Thaksin\\'s policy on the debt suspension for farmers nationwide and the   establishment of a national asset management company have drawn harsh   criticism from economists who said such a move would put the country at   risk as the public debts would rise dramatically.   Respected economist Ammar Siamwala warned that although the Thai Rak   Thai Party\\'s policies will contribute to short-term benefits for people   from all walks of life, they could create staggering financial burden   that must be borne by future generations of taxpayers.   He described as a serious risk the party\\'s debt moratorium plan which   would exempt farmers from interest payment of 18 billion baht (418   million U.S. dollars) per year out of the principal of 300 million baht   (seven million dollars).   Political scientist Prayad Hongthong said that many voters who opted   for Thaksin\\'s party were jumping on the bandwagon, without much real   faith in him.   \"There will be a \\'honeymoon period\\' of few months between Thaksin and   his supporters after he takes office, but he needs to move quickly to   fix various economic problems or he will soon face certain crisis, \" he   said.',\n",

President Wang Tao of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said in   an interview with Xinhua today that China has expanded Sino-foreign   onshore oil cooperation to 21 provinces and autonomous regions,   covering a total area of nearly 2.5 million sq km.   So far, China has signed 34 contracts worth 627 million US dollars with   32 foreign oil giants in terms of oil and gas risk exploration and   technical services.   China, meanwhile, has developed a cumulative crude oil and gas   production capacity of 40.5 million tons and 500 million cu m by taking   advantage of various foreign-supplied loans totalling 9.94 billion US   dollars.   The senior oil official added that China is also making headway in   exploring oil and gas resources in foreign countries.   To date China has already signed five oil contracts abroad and has   successfully obtained a share-holding, operational and development   rights in a series of foreign oil fields.   The CNPC president noted that China has made marked breakthroughs in   undertaking international oil engineering construction projects.

The dollar got up to 1.5815 marks in the early afternoon, but stood in   late afternoon at 1.5715 compared with 1.5680 Wednesday evening in   London.   Chase Manhattan bank analyst Ian Gunner said the dollar was hurt in   late afternoon by profit-taking, as \"operators prefer to take profits   every time the dollar strengthens\". He said the dollar had benefited   during the day from operators\\' caution ahead of release Friday of US   job figures and of the G7 summit conclave in Italy.   \"Market sentiment is still unfavorable to the dollar - but nobody wants   to be caught off base before the G7 in case, though it is unlikely, the   participants agree to support the dollar\", said Gunner.   Economist Lee Ferridge at Natwest Capital Markets bank commented that   all G7 country leaders insist that no decision will be made on the   dollar, \"so certain operators are starting to think it\\'s a trap\". Those   officials have said repeatedly that one should not expect too much from   the G7 parley in the exchange rate field.   While the Bundesbank and the Fed have not changed key interest rates   this week, analysts said the Fed might raise rates if there is a sharp   rise in US job creations, to be reported on Friday.

       " 'training-0146': {'body': '   Hey gang. I got some serious backlash from my hipster column, so I   though I should be fair and take some swipes at their sworn enemies,   the yuppies. Right off the bat, let\\'s be clear about some things. A   yuppie is a Young Urban Professional, so before you go off saying   \"Chris, get out of the 80\\'s,\" please recognize that yuppies have been   around for as long as youth, cities, and professions, which is to say   forever. They continue to infect our cities, and will do so for as long   as legacy status remains a sufficient Ivy League qualification and   conspicuous spending remains an efficient mating strategy. Which is to   say, again, forever. Yuppies will outlive the cockroaches. So lets make   fun of them:    1. When yuppies dance, both of their feet remain FIRMLY planted to       spots on the floor. It is as if the yuppie thinks a high-voltage       current is passing through him, and if he lifts his foot, he will       suffer a fatal discharge. Fatal. That is how serious yuppies take       this foot rule.    2. Yuppies will only discuss cars by their number, never by make. They       will toss around numbers like LS450 and 3-series, and if they do       not immediately see a flash of recognition in your eyes, they will       just assume that you have a micropenis.    3. Yuppies have a peculiar talent whereby, within the first six       minutes of meeting you, they can divert the discussion towards       details of their life that they hope will impress you. This       typically involves letting you know that they had a college       scholarship or played a varsity sport. But the particular details       are inconsequential. It is the conversational acrobatics that       yuppies employ to impart these details to you that are so       impressive. For instance, yuppy males absolutely love to alert you       that they have a great girlfriend, and they might do so thusly:     Me: Hi, nice to meet you, I\\'m Christopher Walken.     Yuppy: Walken? My girlfriend loves walking! She walks everywh...     (shotgun blast)    4. Yuppies know the names of all the tall buildings in the city, and       if you attend a rooftop party, they will not hesitate to take an       hour out of your night to educate you. They will be sure to speak       very loudly so that all the other yuppies around are aware of their       skyscraper nomenclature mastery.    5. There are no real-life yuppies as cool as Patrick Bateman. He is a       golden god.       Patrick Bateman       Image courtesy of imdb.com    6. Yuppies like to go slumming in the Lower East Side, because it is       the only part of Manhattan that is \"still real.\" YEAH, BECAUSE YOU       MOUTHBREATHERS RUINED THE REST OF IT.    7. Yuppies do not have actual conversations with one another. The       simply wait for their turn to regurgitate something that TV told       them earlier. If you regularly interact with yuppies, you can       recognize this phenomenon and take advantage of it. When you are       trying to talk to one of these robots, you will notice their eyes       glaze over as they recite their upcoming line over and over in       their head. It is at this moment that you should say something       absolutely absurd, just to see if you can slip it by. For instance:     Yuppy: You catch that Cowboys game this weekend?     Me: Yes, I saw parts of it.     Yuppy: Did you see T.O. crying afterwards? What a PUSSY!     Me: Indeed.     Yuppy: You think he was faking it? I think he was faking it.     Me: Well, tough to tell. I mean, he is a complex person...     Yuppy: (glaze)     Me: ...additionally, I heard he has a small vestigial tail, and if     you lick it, you acquire the magical power to intuit a person\\'s most     ticklish spot, simply by sniffing them...     Yuppy: (pause)     Yuppy: Romo should\\'ve focused on the playoffs, not on that tramp     Jessica Simpson.   Ok, I think that\\'s it for now. Rest assured that the vanities remain in   flames.

The government is to adopt the same limit on ordinary and   checking-account deposits a year later.   The move is feared to prompt mass withdrawals from banks weakened from   years of bad loans dating back to the \"bubble economy\" investment boom   which burst in the early 1990\\'s.   According to the Bank of Japan, 25.9 trillion yen was withdrawn from   time deposits of over 10 million yen at banks last year.   US credit rating agency Standard and Poor\\'s warned on Thursday that   because of the limit to government guarantees, depositors would take   more extensive credit protection measures, such as shortening deposit   maturities or shifting funds to stronger banks.   The premier on Wednesday vowed to use public funds \"if necessary\" to   help banks as Japan\\'s tightest budget in four years was enacted amid   lingering fears of a financial meltdown.   Banks have been particularly hit by a downslide in Japanese share   prices in the past year which snowballed their unrealised losses.   But share prices have rallied in recent weeks after the government   imposed curbs on short-selling a month earlier and began to revise its   economic forecasts upward while corporations prepared to close their   annual accounts.   In the interview, Koizumi hinted that in the future he might scrap his   pledge to limit the issuance of new government bonds to 30 trillion yen   per year to help the government reduce its huge deficits.   He said the limit had been necessary \"in order to maintain discipline   in state finances.\"   Asked if the restriction would be considered when working out a state   budget for the year starting in April 2003, the premier said: \"We want   to think in a bold and flexible manner mindful of the situation.\"   \"We will have to be aware that the economy is moving.\"',\n",

The day is not here yet   and it will not be until all the world\\'s nations act to guarantee the   right of children and other innocents to survive in a world free of   these murderous devices,\" Bellamy added.   UNICEF has been designated within the UN family as the lead agency to   educate and advocate on the landmine issue. Educational campaigns have   centered on teaching children about the danger of landmines and safety   procedures to follow in mined areas. Almost all mined countries served   by UNICEF have an educational program in place.',\n",

       " 'training-1443': {'body': '   The fall of the Berlin Wall was a spectacular historical event. As Eric   Hobsbawm points out in his new book, The Age of Extremes, it   effectively brought the history of the 20th century to an abrupt and   premature end.   From the October Revolution in 1917, that history had been dominated by   the contest between capitalism and Communism; 1989 resolved that   conflict once and for all.   In the months that followed the air was filled with optimism and   triumphalism. The tone was set by the likes of Margaret Thatcher and   Ronald Reagan, who saw it as a vindication of their military and   political stance during the Eighties and confirmation of the robust   qualities of the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism.   With the old enemy defeated, the West looked forward to a world that   would be remade in its own image.   In central Europe, these hopes have, for the most part, not been   disappointed.   In Germany, the task of absorbing a country of 18 million people with a   much lower standard of living was colossal and risked provoking painful   echoes of the past.   In fact, Germany has remained economically formidable and impressively   stable, with the far right confined to the margins of the political   stage.   To the east, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have embraced   democracy and the market economy with some success, Slovakia, Bulgaria   and Romania with rather less. But the balance sheet is, on the whole,   more positive than might have been reasonably hoped in 1989.   Events in the former Yugoslavia, though, are proof of how things can go   wrong.   Everywhere Communism led to the suppression of good things and bad. In   1989, we paid little attention to the potential downside, in particular   the dangers of sectarianism and nationalism, which continue to wreak   bloody havoc in the Balkans.   The former Yugoslavia stands as a reminder that evil is not   conterminous with Communism.   The events of 1989 were, of course, about central Europe, not the   former Soviet Union. Yet somehow in the historical memory, the end of   Communism in that country is now lodged as a postscript.   The fortunes of the former states of the Soviet Union were always going   to be more precarious and unpredictable than those of central Europe.   Ethnic conflict is rife in the former empire and democracy at best   sporadic. At least it can be said that so far the worst has been   avoided.   Meanwhile, the effects of the end of the Cold War have been felt far   and wide. One of the most encouraging consequences has been the   settlement, or moves towards the settlement, of conflicts that   previously seemed intractable.   The end of the Cold War created a new atmosphere: if the oldest and   worst conflict could be resolved, then why not others? South Africa,   the Middle East and even Ireland fall into this category.   The most unexpected consequence of 1989 has been in the West. At the   time it was seen simply and unequivocally as a victory for the West and   a defeat for the East. It was interpreted as a triumphant endorsement   of Western values.   In fact, it has turned out very different. Since the events of 1989,   the West has been riven by doubt and uncertainty. Respect for   politicians has plummeted.   It is clear with hindsight that the Cold War not only froze politics in   the East but also the West. The classic example has been Italy, where   we have witnessed eastern Europe in reverse: a dominant-party state   that owed its survival to the Cold War and began to disintegrate almost   as soon as it was over.   For the first time in a postwar Western democracy, the political system   collapsed with ramifications that are still unclear. But Italy merely   provides the extreme example of a general tendency in Western   democracies.   The Cold War provided a compelling discipline for society. Rather like   real wars, it reinforced the authority of the political class,   constrained debate, defined national objectives, provided a simple   guide to right and wrong, and held in check deeper underlying pressures   for change.   In particular, the end of the Cold War suggests two things. First,   traditional Western-style democracy is now obsolescent, thrown on to   the defensive by the sheer dynamism and modernity of both civil society   and the market. Western polities and democracy must now be rethought.   Second, the Cold War helped to sustain the legitimacy and relevance of   a political system which, like itself, was based on the left/right   polarity.   By the same token, its end has reminded us that this polarity is   becoming less useful as a way of explaining the world and offering   solutions to its problems.   Finally, the Cold War served to obscure the meaning and significance of   the growing power of East Asia.   The Cold War was, by definition, Eurocentric. Its fault line divided   Europe, and its ideologies were made there.   Of course, the rise of East Asia, in the form of the Pacific Rim, had   been recognized in the Seventies, but it is only in the Nineties, with   the end of the Cold War, that it is beginning to take its rightful   place on the global stage, driven in part by the remarkable economic   growth of China.   1989 heralded the decline of Europe and a shift in the global center of   gravity towards the east, this time Asia rather than Eurasia. The   consequences of this have so far been little discussed, little felt,   but could turn out to be the most profound of all.   The Anglo-Saxon model may have looked like the winner when the Berlin   Wall tumbled, but it is no longer unchallenged as the model to emulate.',\n",

Peres met the European Union\\'s senior foreign policy official and   addressed the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to defend   Israel\\'s pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to crack down on   militants.   \"If Arafat doesn\\'t bring an end to terrorism, terrorism will bring an   end to him,\" he warned.   But the Israeli minister was faced with opposition to his government\\'s   stance from Europeans angry that Israeli troops have destroyed   Palestinian installations paid for by the aid budgets of the EU and its   member states.   \"The situation today is very dramatic and we have to see how to get out   of the cycle of violence,\" EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said   after a 45-minute meeting with Peres.   As Peres arrived in Strasbourg tempers were again rising in Israel and   the Palestinian territory after an Israeli raid on the Palestinian town   of Nablus and a rampage in Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman left a   total of seven dead.   The meeting with Solana came one day after the presidency of the   European Union denounced the Israeli policy of pressuring Arafat by   besieging him in his Ramallah office and destroying Palestinian   infrastructure and homes.   \"From our point of view, these acts have nothing to do with the   security needs which the Israeli authorities put forward,\" said Foreign   Minister Josep Pique of Spain, which currently holds 15-nation bloc\\'s   rotating presidency.   Many of the installations destroyed in recent Israeli raids, including   Gaza\\'s port and airport and a Palestinian broadcasting centre, were   built with the help of EU aid money.   Israeli security forces have inflicted damage worth 17.3 million euros   (15 million dollars) on EU-funded installations in the Palestinian   territories, said a spokesman for European Commissioner for Foreign   Affairs Chris Patten.   A senior European source told AFP that the European Commission was   considering demanding compensation from Israel for the damage done to   the installations, and would send a letter of protest in the coming   days.   \"It\\'s a question that needs to be studied on a legal level,\" the   official said.   Peres defended the attack on the airport and radio station, claiming   Palestinians had fired on Israeli observers watching the airport to   prevent arms smuggling and that the radio broadcasted propaganda.   The Council of Europe has also invited Peres\\' opposite number in   negotiations to restart the troubled peace process, Palestinian cabinet   minister Saeb Erakat, but it was not clear when he would arrive.   One of the consequences of the destruction of Gaza airport was that   Erakat\\'s travel plans had been made more complicated, although he was   expected to address the assembly by Thursday, Council of Europe   delegates said.   Erakat will not meet Peres, who is due later Wednesday in the   Netherlands, where he will meet Prime Minister Wim Kok.   On Thursday Peres is to address a conference on the peace process at   Rotterdam\\'s Erasmus university.   On Tuesday a lone Palestinian gunman opened fire at random in a crowded   Jerusalem street and wounded almost 40 people -- two of them fatally --   before being shot dead by police.   Earlier, Israeli troops had raided the West Bank town of Nablus,   killing four members of the radical Islamic movement Hamas and   triggering a riot in which another Palestinian man was shot dead by   Palestinian forces.   In response to the Nablus raid a coalition of Palestinian groups,   including the radical Islamic movement Hamas and Arafat\\'s Fatah   faction, called for a \"general mobilisation\" against Israel.',\n",

De Beers, which controls most of the world diamond market, hopes a new   marketing agreement being discussed with Russia can be finalised before   the country goes to the polls in June, spokesman Andrew Cummine said.   In February, De Beers and the Russian monopoly Almazy Rossii-Sakha   agreed in principle on a complex deal that would allow the Russian firm   greater access to the open market.   De Beers also offered to buy at least 1.1 billion dollars\\' worth of   diamonds from Russia every year.   Under a current agreement, Russia is allowed to sell only 5.0 percent   of its diamonds on the open market, but De Beers claims Moscow   regularly violated the accord by secretly selling on the black market.   Under the deal now being negotiated, Russia would be allowed to sell   about 12.5 percent of its production without going through De Beers.   \"We sincerely hope that any new government ... in Russia, would find it   in their own interest to preserve existing diamond agreements,\" Cummine   said.   The talks and the Russian election are on the daily agenda of South   African Minister of Mineral Affairs Pik Botha, ministry spokesman   Roland Darroll said.   \"We obviously believe that any event which can potentially affect our   diamond industry is of the highest importance,\" he said, but refused   further comment.   Johannesburg\\'s Business Day newspaper on Tuesday quoted unnamed   analysts as saying any diamond marketing agreement involving Russia   could not be finalised until after the country\\'s elections. The   analysts also believed that a government change in Russia would not   affect the potential agreement, as it was favourable to Moscow.   Cummine said both parties were eager to finalise a deal \"as soon as   possible.\"   Almazy Rossii-Sakha has repeatedly told De Beers it urgently requires   the cash a new agreement would provide, Cummine said, but added: \"The   political transformation in Russia has brought with it a few inevitable   delays.\"',\n",

It was the first time since 1994 that the top seed in the women \\'s   Wimbledon draw went out in the first round -- back then it was Steffi   Graf who was sent packing by American Lori McNeil.   The only other top seed to lose in the first round of a Grand Slam   since the Open Era began in 1968 was Virginia Ruzici of Romania who was   upset by Margaret Sawyer at the 1979 Australian Open.   Hingis started the season in fine fashion, winning the Australian Open   for the third consecutive year, which included a third round victory   over Dokic in their only other encounter.   However, on the lawn, the 16-year-old Dokic, who made her debut at   Wimbledon via the qualifying tournament, did the unthinkable in an   astonishing Court One performance.   The Australian, world junior champion last year, broke Hingis twice in   the first set and then looked in a class of her own for the rest of the   match.   She made the Swiss star look like a novice, running her around the   court and smashing winners past her at will, before completing the   sensational shock victory in just 54 minutes.   \"It\\'s amazing, just amazing,\" Dokic said as 1987 men\\'s champion Pat   Cash embraced her afterwards.   \"I guess I still can\\'t believe I beat her,\" said the No. 129 ranked   Dokic, smiling. \"It was a big win for me, coming from qualifying.

Hingis, who won here in 1997, said she planned to take a break from   tennis and appeared to have split from her coach -- her mother Melanie.   \"Maybe I just need a break from everything right now. A break would   really suit me,\" she said.   \"This tournament, we decided to have a little bit of distance,\" vHingis   admitted. \"We\\'ll probably work a bit more on our private lives and see   how its is going to go in the future.\"   In another women\\'s singles match, Jennifer Capriati of the United   States beat Germany\\'s Anke Huber 5-7, 6-3, 9-7 when the suspended match   resumed today.

Third seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States crushed Alexandra   Fusai of France 6-0, 6-3 while Spanish seventh-seed Arantxa Sanchez   Vicario recovered from a slow start to beat Hungary\\'s Annamaria   Foldenyi 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.   The men stayed out of the limelight on the traditional Ladies\\' Day at   Wimbledon, avoiding shock upsets - but only just.   Three-time champion Boris Becker battled from two sets down and saved   three match points in the fourth set against Briton Miles MacLagan to   keep his final Wimbledon dream alive.   The 31-year-old unseeded German finally subdued the unheralded Scot   5-7, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 for a victory as great as any he achieved in   his glory years a decade ago.   He was joined in the second round by third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov who   narrowly avoided defeat when his darkness-delayed first round match   with Magnus Larsson resumed at two sets apiece and 5-5 in the fifth.   The Russian former world number one eventually squeezed through 6-7,   7-5, 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.   Andre Agassi hardly put a foot wrong on center court as the form that   took him to the French Open title this month continued on grass and he   thrashed Romanian Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-2, 6-3.   Second seed Pat Rafter dealt with Cristiano Caratti of Italy 6- 3, 6-2,   6-2, while Brazilian 11th-seed Gustavo Kuerten recorded his first   victory on grass beating Chris Wilkinson 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.',\n",

       " 'training-0920': {'body': \"   High doses of a common pain reliever slowed lung deterioration by 90   percent over four years in children with cystic fibrosis, a study   found.   The benefits of ibuprofen -- sold under such brand names as Advil,   Nuprin and Motrin -- were most dramatic in children ages 5 to 13 who   consistently took it twice a day in addition to conventional treatments   with other drugs, the study's authors said. Ibuprofen might also have   some reduced benefit in older patients, the researchers said.   The pain reliever is sold in the United States without a perscription.   ``I think this study suggests it's a valid therapy to introduce into   the clinic,'' said one of the authors, Dr. Pamela Davis of Rainbow   Babies and Childrens Hospital in Cleveland. The study appears Thursday   in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Doctors agreed that the addition of the new treatment is likely to   increase the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients, although it   will be years before that is proven. With current treatments, half of   the 1,000 new patients diagnosed each year die before age 30.   Davis cautioned patients not to begin treating themselves with the   drug, because it can have harmful side effects if it isn't used   correctly. It can harm the stomach and kidneys and interfere with other   drugs used to treat cystic fibrosis, she said.   ``One of the things we're worried about is that the drug is available   over the counter. We would absolutely not suggest that CF patients go   down to the drug store and buy the drug and start popping it,'' she   said.   Part of the lung damage that occurs in cystic fibrosis is caused by   inflammation of the lungs. Ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, helps to   control that.   Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal inherited disease of   Americans. About 30,000 Americans, mostly whites, are afflicted with   the disease, and one in 25 white Americans is a carrier of the CF gene.   The disease occurs only in those who get two copies of the gene, one   from each parent.   Davis and her colleagues studied 85 patients ages 5 to 39. Some were   given ibuprofen and some were given placebo for a period of four years.   Doses were adjusted individually, with some patients taking the   equivalent of 16 over-the-counter tablets a day. The recommended dose   is normally one or two tablets every four to six hours, with a maximum   of six tablets in 24 hours.   In a standard measure of lung function in which patients are asked to   exhale as quickly as they can, the researchers saw a 16 percent decline   in the placebo group over the four years, compared with only a 2   percent decline in the members of the ibuprofen group ages 5 to 13 who   took their medication consistently.   That represents a slowing of 90 percent in lung deterioration, she   said. The numbers were corrected to allow for growth of the children   during the time they were studied, she said.\",\n",

Fears that such events could   delay Iraqi oil exports are unjustified because Gulf states could make   up for the loss.\"   Iraq had been on the verge of resuming oil exports under an agreement   signed with the United Nations in May to sell two billion dollars of   crude every six months to buy food and medicine for its sanctions-hit   people.   But the UN said on Sunday it would postpone the implementation of the   agreement because of Baghdad\\'s offensive against Kurdish strongholds in   northern Iraq, an Allied-patrolled \"safe haven.\"   In an address on Tuesday, US President Bill Clinton also dismissed an   immediate resumption of Iraqi oil sales, saying the oil-for-food accord   could not go forward until Washington is satisfied with the   distribution of humanitarian supplies to all Iraqis including the   Kurds.   The delay to the agreement could deprive the world oil market of around   700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iraqi oil.   Oil analysts said they could not speculate on the date of the   resumption of Iraqi crude supplies in the wake of the US cruise missile   strike.   But they maintained any shortage in supplies could be offset by Saudi   Arabia and other Gulf Arab producers given their large spare capacity.   \"I don\\'t know what turn the events will take following the US attack   and defiant statements by (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein,\" one expert   said.   \"But I believe this is not a problem for the oil market so long as the   conflict is confined there... there is much oil elsewhere.\"   At talks in Vienna in June, oil ministers of the Organisation of   Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to allocate Iraq an additional   production quota of 800,000 bpd to implement its agreement with the UN   to export limited quantities of oil for the first time since it came   under an oil and trade embargo for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.   A postponement of the agreement could cut off necessary supplies to a   thirsty market as demand is about to pick up in the last quarter and a   large part of supplies has been consumed by industrial countries   seeking to replenish their stocks after a prolonged winter.   But Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s top oil producer and exporter, has around   two million bpd in spare capacity while Kuwait and the United Arab   Emirates (UAE) are also producing far below their capacity.   Saudi Arabia and the UAE hiked their production by more than three   million bpd during the 1991 Gulf war to make up for the disruption of   Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude exports. This helped bring down oil prices   after they shot up to 30 dollars.   News of the weekend Iraqi offensive against the main Kurdish city of   Arbil in northern Iraq sent oil prices above 21 dollars.   On Tuesday they climbed above 22 dollars, one of their highest levels   in many years, after the Pentagon announced the missile attack on   military targets in southern Iraq.   \"Gulf Arab states have the capacity to meet demand in the fourth   quarter even if Iraq could not start exports,\" a Gulf oil official told   AFP.   \"Of course we are benefiting from the increase in oil prices but we   will not allow prices to go up too high. We believe that we have an   obligation towards consumers because we share common interests.   \"We are prepared for any possibility to ensure the stability of the oil   market.

The   country has the highest proportion of children who die from shooting   incidents among the 26 richest countries in the world, with more than   7,000 children killed by gunshot wounds each year.   A study by the Washington-based Children's Defence Fund released in   March of 1997 said that one person below the age of 20 is killed by a   gun every ninety minutes and children below the age of 15 die are 12   times more likely to be killed by a gun than in 25 other industrialized   countries combined.   Child abuse is a serious problem in the U.S. Every ten seconds a child   is either abused or suffering from neglect, and each year, about   130,000 children suffer from sexual abuse, 2,000 children die from   abuse, and 250,000 are physically attacked.   A government survey report released on January 11 showed that the   number of children suffering from abuse or neglect increased from 1.4   million in 1986 to more than 3 million in 1997. Each year, 1,046   children die from maltreatment and lack of proper care and the younger   the child is the more susceptible to physical abuse it is. About 82   percent of the children killed are below the age of five, and nearly 44   percent are one or younger (28).\",\n",

Michael Jackson during the finale of last month\\'s \"United We Stand\"   benefit concert.   \"Whether ravaged by war, disease, natural disaster, or just plain   grinding poverty, there are a whole heck of a lot of people out there   in desperate need of a star-studded fundraiser at Madison Square   Garden,\" ECOSOC president Martin Belinga-Eboutou said. \"Or, if not   that, a Quincy Jones-produced remake of \\'What\\'s Going On\\' featuring   everyone from P. Diddy to \\'N Sync to U2\\'s Bono.\"   Belinga-Eboutou pointed to the recent success of Concert For New York   City, a five-and-a-half-hour extravaganza featuring such superstars as   Elton John, Mick Jagger, Backstreet Boys, Paul McCartney, and Destiny\\'s   Child, among others. Earnings from the benefit, which aired on VH1 and   will soon be released as a double-disc CD, are expected to surpass the   $150 million raised in last month\\'s all-star America: A Tribute To   Heroes telethon.   \"If we could get something like that going in the 315,583 places on the   globe the U.N. has identified as \\'in crisis,\\' we\\'d really have   something,\" Belinga-Eboutou said.   Belinga-Eboutou cited Gujarat, the Indian state where a January   earthquake killed an estimated 100,000 people and left nearly one   million homeless, as an example of a region that could use a night of   star-studded \"compassiontainment.\"   \"If Jerry Seinfeld could see it in his heart to toss off a few of his   trademark observational one-liners for the needy people of Gujarat, it   would greatly alleviate the suffering they have endured,\"   Belinga-Eboutou said. \"And the rock stylings of a reunited Who would be   much appreciated, as well.\"   Last week, the U.N. established an exploratory committee to begin the   arduous task of assigning stars to the world\\'s trouble spots. However,   with the ratio of needy locales to bankable stars standing at 4,390 to   1, an estimated 800 two-hour concerts per celebrity would be required   over the next year to set things right in the world. These figures are   also contingent upon no further natural or man-made catastrophes   occurring during that time period.   Though only in its initial stages, the deployment of stars has already   begun. Last week, R&B sensation Pink was dispatched to Indonesia to   raise money for the families of the 350 asylum-seeking refugees who   drowned in an overcrowded boat last month, while Arista recording   artist Dido is slated to perform Nov. 27 in war-torn Macedonia. In   addition, the \\'80s new-wave band Soft Cell has agreed to reunite for   three December shows in AIDS-ravaged South Africa.   New York concert promoter Ron Delsener, who is in talks to organize   more than 22,000 relief concerts on behalf of the U.N., said the   logistical problems such a humanitarian effort would present are   considerable.   \"There just aren\\'t any adequate venues for, say, an Ozzy Osbourne show   in Sierra Leone,\" Delsener said. \"No stadiums, no arenas, not even a   large auditorium. And have you ever tried tracking down a pyrotechnics   expert with a union card in sub-Saharan Africa? It\\'s practically   impossible.\"   Delsener also noted that the cost of providing adequate security at   such a concert would be greater than the gross national product of the   nation in need.   Despite such challenges, Third World leaders are urging musicians to do   whatever they can.   \"It is up to each and every star to pitch in,\" said Nicaraguan   president Jos\\xe9 Arnoldo Alem\\xe1n Lacayo, whose drought-ravaged country   will soon receive help in the form of Eagle-Eye Cherry. \"From heavy   hitters such as Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen to young upstarts like   Macy Gray, the world needs all the singers it can get.\"   The world\\'s impoverished received more good news Monday, when George   Harrison, whose 1971 Concert For Bangladesh was the first all-star   fundraiser, said plans are underway for a follow-up show.   \"I\\'ve already talked to Ringo [Starr] and Eric Clapton, and Tom Petty   appears to be interested, too,\" Harrison said. \"The Concert For   Bangladesh was such a big success, there\\'s no reason to think that this   upcoming Concert For Albania, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan,   Belarus, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana,   Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African   Republic, Chad, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, C\\xf4te d\\'Ivoire, Croatia,   Cuba, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia,   Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran,   Iraq, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lesotho,   Liberia, Libya, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Mongolia,   Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger,   Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, The Philippines,   Romania, Russia, Rwanda, Senegal, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone,   Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania,   Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,   Vietnam, Yugoslavia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe won\\'t be just as   great.\"',\n",

The cuts would affect everyone, he warned.   \"I am preparing to take extremely firm measures in the next few days to   deal with the budget for 1995,\" he said in remarks on French radio.   \"It is my duty to respect the deficit which was set by parliament in   July. We must not exceed 321 billion francs.   \"There will be new cuts and everyone, believe me, will have to   contribute.\"   His remarks were seen as highlighting problems facing the centre-right   government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe in containing the deficit this   year as part of an ambitious plan to reduce the deficit to three   percent of gross domestic product in 1997 in time for France to be a   founder of a single European currency.   Deep doubts among international financiers that the government can   introduce tough measures to achieve this, and will stand up to social   unrest in protest at such austerity, have undermined credibility in the   franc.   The member of parliament responsible for summarising work on the budget   for next year by the parliamentary finance commission said on Monday   that the budget for 1996 was rather \"anaemic\".   He said that there were \"still some savings to be made\".   During debate in the commission supporters of the government revolted   three times last week to cut the deficit by more than the government   had intended.

       " 'training-1031': {'body': '   The United States and Cuba announced an agreement Friday to halt the   exodus of Cuban refugees, possibly ending a major foreign policy   headache for President Bill Clinton.   The accord reached after a week of negotiations calls for expanded   legal immigration of Cubans into the United States, with Havana   agreeing to take action to stop emigrants from leaving illegally on   makeshift boats and rafts.   \"The United States and the Republic of Cuba recognize the common   interest in preventing unsafe departure from Cuba which risks the loss   of human life,\" said a joint statment issued in New York, where   negotiations were held.   The accord allows legal immigration of at least 20,000 Cubans into the   United States each year, along with an estimated 500 relatives of   Cubans already living in the United States, officials said.   Additionally, some 6,000 Cubans currently on a waiting list for US   visas will be allowed to immigrate.   \"This agreement, when carried out, will help insure that the massive   flow of dangerous and illegal migration will be replaced by a safer,   legal and more orderly process,\" Clinton said in a statement issued in   New Orleans, Lousiana, where he was travelling.   \"It\\'s a fair, a good agreement,\" Clinton said, boarding Air Force One   in in New Orleans. \"It\\'s good for the United States.\"   Michael Skol, the chief US negotiator, said the estimated 25,000 Cubans   detained at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay or taken to refugee   centers in Panama would have to return to Cuba to apply for a visa   under the agreement.   Havana will arrange for the repatriation of Cubans who recently left   and wish to return to Cuba, according to the joint statement.   White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said it was not immediately clear   what would happen to those Cubans being detained who did not want to   return to the communist-ruled island with serious economic woes.   In Havana, state television announcers read the text of the accord   without offering any commentary. The state news agency Prensa Latina   also released the text without further comment.   Analysts said the accord gives Clinton a much-needed political victory   because it gives no concession to Havana on ending the 32-year-old US   economic embargo.   And that was especially important for Clinton because he agreed to   talks only after Cuban President Fidel Castro announced August 6 that   Havana would stop turning back Cubans who wanted to leave by sea,   unleashing a flood of Cuban boat people seeking US shores in the   Florida Straits.   Clinton said the US would not let Castro dictate US immigration policy,   but then reversed the longstanding US policy of granting Cubans instant   asylum, which Castro demanded, saying it was fostering illegal   emigration.   In New York, Cuban officials sought to expand the talks to discussions   on ending the US embargo.   But Washington insisted the talks be limited to migration issues,   arguing that Havana must move toward democracy before the question of   normalizing relations can be addressed.   The agreement could give Clinton time to concentrate on another foreign   policy crisis in the region, Haiti, where a US invasion could come at   any time as part of a UN effort to restore democratic rule.   The US-Cuban statement said both sides agreed they would work toward   \"directing Cuban migration into safe, legal and orderly channels   consistent with strict immplementation of the 1984 joint communique,\" a   reference to an earlier accord setting the quota of 20,000 Cubans per   year allowed to immigrate.   Despite the ceiling of 20,000, only about 3,000 Cubans have been able   to immigrate legal to the United States in recent years. Havana blamed   US bureaucracy for failing to live up the the agreement, but Washington   maintained that potential immigrants were afraid of reprisals in Cuba.   In an effort to halt the exodus, Clinton announced August 19 the United   States would no longer grant instant asylum to Cubans arriving   illegally in the United States and would take refugees picked up at sea   to third countries.   At least 29,000 Cuban refugees have been picked up at sea by US patrols   since early August.   The US Coast Guard rescued 610 Cubans Thursday and 86 by midday Friday,   down considerably from 1,029 on Wednesday. The exodus peaked August 23   when 3,253 were picked up.   The refugee crisis was sparked in early August when Castro reacted to   the worst demonstrations in Havana to date against his government by   saying that he would no longer stop people from leaving.   Thousands then took to the seas in a bid to cross the Florida Straits   and reach Florida, prompting Clinton to take steps to dissuade their   departures.   Refugees who were intercepted at sea by the US coast guard were   diverted to makeshift camps at the Guantanamo US naval base in   southeastern Cuba, while Washington decided what to do with them.',\n",

The agreement would involve two separate loans totalling 800 million   dollars, which Hungary plans to spend on budgetary reform and   structural changes.   The delegation, led by Leslie Lipschitz, is to meet with Finance   Minister Lajos Bokros, head of the central National Bank Gyorgy   Suranyi, Minister of Industry and Trade Imre Dunai and Privatisation   Minister Tamas Suchman.   It is to review an ongoing economic stabilisation programme of   Hungary's social-liberal cabinet, and is to look into a new three-year   plan of economic strategy as well as next year's budget.   Preliminary reports said that the IMF liked Hungary's stabilisation   plan and was satisfied with the country's target for a budget deficit   of 258 billion forints (1.9 billion dollars) next year, which would   make 3.9 percent of the GDP, Finance Ministry officials said.   At earlier talks, the IMF looked at the the deficit remaining at three   percent of the GDP as a precondition to a standby loan, and it also   said it wanted further austerity measures on top of the ones adopted by   the government in March and adopted by Parliament in June.   It also said that it wanted a monetary and wage reform aimed at   strengthening the country's international competitiveness.   The cabinet's three-year plan wants to gradually cut the deficit to   below three percent of ther GDP by 1998, to cut inflation to below 15   percent from the current 25 percent, and to create the conditions for   permanent growth, Deputy State Secretary Tamas Tetenyi of the ministry   said Wednesday.   He said that for growth, Hungary has to keep its current account   deficit below the working capital influx, or below 1.5 billion dollars.   (Last year, the current account deficit almost reached four billion   dollars.)   He added that to achieve that goal, people in Hungary will pay a high   price next year, as real wages will fall and living conditions will   visibly deteriorate.\",\n",

Sales declined by 12 percent to 43.3 billion marks (9.42 billion   dollars) from 49.2 billion marks in 1994.

Focusing on the   pivotal years in the mid-1920s when many European architects embraced   the common language of the modern movement, the show, which runs   through Sunday, looked back to the dawn of a radiant idea.   The Palazzo Della Trienalle, which was designed in 1931 by Giovanni   Muzio, is best known as the site of an international design event that   once presented the most innovative ideas in the field.

Aulenti's new galleries have been   conceived not only to burnish the Trienalle's reputation but also to   reconfigure its mission.   The palazzo's large ground-floor interiors were designed as flexible   spaces, so that exhibitors could overhaul them to suit their needs.   But, like their counterparts at the Pompidou Center in Paris, the   Trienalle's directors decided that some exhibitions would be better   served by a permanent setting.   Aulenti, architect of the Pompidou's renovated permanent galleries, was   a logical choice to undertake the same job here. As someone who has   often felt that Aulenti's work, while always intelligent, shows a weak   command of space, I am happy to report that her design for Milan is   first-rate.   As with her renovations of the Palazzo Grassi in Venice and the Musee   d'Orsay in Paris, Aulenti took on a landmark building. A product of the   fascist era, the Palazzo Della Trienalle represented an attempt to fuse   the two leading movements that competed to become the official fascist   style.   Neo-classicism, the style most often identified with the regime,   dominates the design, with its imposing, symmetrical entrance, the rows   of high Roman arches that surround the lower floors and such features   as the grand staircase that jackknifes through the atrium lobby.   But the regime also supported Rationalism, Italy's leading modern   movement, and its influence is evident in the bare, brick warehouse   look of the exterior walls, the exposed concrete structure and the   loftlike interiors of the exhibition floors.   Gae Aulenti continues this synthesis of modern and classical forms. Her   simple, spare design for the 10,000-square-foot ground-floor space is   based on an ingenious system of partitions. Each partition is, in   effect, an extruded column, topped with a ``capital'' that flares   outward to support small clusters of lamps.   Though classically sympathetic, the walls are modern in their geometric   clarity as well as in their function, for each partition is also a   mechanical device that houses equipment for lighting, security and   air-conditioning. Set parallel to form corridors, or rotated to enclose   a gallery, the convex partitions create spaces at once intimate and   ample.   The partitions stop short of the 23-foot-high ceiling, exposing the   concrete structure. Starkly geometric, yet richly textured by the   shadowed recesses between the concrete beams, the roof creates a   counterpoint to Aulenti's broad expanses of white wall and the diffuse   light that washes over them.   Floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto Sempione Park, and at moments   Aulenti's design seems to pull the park indoors, as if the partitions   had become a terrace colonnade, or, more fancifully, rows of spreading   trees. With their dappled light glinting off a floor of dark stained   wood, these galleries are a winter garden of shadows.\",\n",

The original master chip, from which all calculators across the globe   were developed, shows 29.90 x 19.560 = 584.844. The answer is, of   course, 584.484. And the disturbing news is that there may be many more   errors hidden on every calculator\\'s functions.   While these few decimal points may not seem too significant, when   applied to the laws of physics, engineering, mechanics etc, the results   can be, and have been, catastrophic.   Professor Sefton Delmer of Beijing Technical Academy, who headed the   investigating project team, said: \"Basically, any equation that   involves, somewhere along the line, the multiplication of these two   numbers will give you a wrong answer.   \"That\\'s maybe not too significant if you\\'re calculating how many rolls   of wallpaper to buy but if you\\'re designing an aeroplane wing or a   heart valve then oops!\"   The investigating team, comprising technical and scientific experts   from every imaginable field, is confident that all so-called mechanical   failures\\' can be attributed to this computing flaw.   The original multiplication chip, which became the master\\' for all   subsequent chips, was developed by a small Japanese firm, Xena   Logistics, in 1968. Although the company ceased trading in \\'72, one   former worker, Haruki Asahara (73), remembers being part of the   original development team.   \"Kanezane Matsukata was in charge of the multiplication feature,\" Mr   Asahara recalled. \"He died many years ago in a tragic accident when the   wheels came off his car and he slid into a de-railed train.   \"I think he checked most of the multiplication options but there are so   many numbers, you can understand how one was missed. In fact, I\\'d be   surprised if calculators aren\\'t riddled with errors.\"   Mr Ashara said the initial development of the calculator was aimed at   the educational toy market.   \"We saw it as something that could help children with their math   studies, maybe make their homework a little bit less stressful,\" he   said. \"We certainly were very careful with whole numbers up to a 100.   \"We had no idea it would catch on and become so widespread. You\\'d have   thought people would have checked the numbers before building their   rockets, aeroplanes, bridges   \"You don\\'t really trust a barometer do you?

The 1995-1999 plan is expected to witness strict financial discipline   as officials have already made clear spending cuts would be the main   feature of the coming budgets to trim the deficit and ease rising debt.   Bankers in Saudi Arabia said they expected an average 40 billion   dollars would be spent annually through the five-year plan, close to   the level in the previous year and nearly half the annual expenditure   during the oil boom.   \"According to our information, there is a strong trend to keep   expenditure at an average 40 billion dollars a year although the   Kingdom\\'s oil production is likely to rise in the next few years,\" one   banker said.   \"The new five-year plan will envisage spending almost equivalent to the   previous plan\\'s expenditure of around 200 billion dollars. This of   course does not include financial contributions to the liberation of   Kuwait.\"   Saudi Arabia paid more than 50 billion dollars to the US-led   multinational coalition that ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait in   February 1991 after nearly seven months of occupation.   The payments, coupled with low oil prices and unchanged Saudi output,   sharply pushed up the budget deficit. This forced Riyadh to slash   spending in 1994 to 42.66 billion dollars from 52.53 billion dollars in   1993, reducing the shortfall to around 1.2 billion dollars from 7.4   billion dollars.   King Fahd on Friday announced plans for another 20 percent cut next   year.   A general outline of the sixth development plan, obtained by AFP on   Thursday, showed it would concentrate on economic reforms,   rationalisation of expenditure, upgrading efficiency in public   facilities and training of local manpower as part of plans to reduce   reliance on foreigners.   \"The main objectives of this plan include increasing the role of the   private sector in the national economy without affecting the standard   of services and a continuation of the policy to lessen reliance on oil   in order to achieve a real change in the country\\'s economic structure,\"   it showed.   \"The plan will also concentrate on development of the local manpower,   improvement of performance at public utilities, and expansion of the   productive base, especially in industry, farming and mining.\"   Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s biggest oil producer and exporter, has   announced plans to privatise its communication, aviation, post and   other sectors to tap the enormous resources of its private sector and   gradually remove heavy government subsidies that constitute an added   burden on the budget.   Apart from persistent budget shortfalls, low oil prices have created   deficits in Saudi Arabia\\'s balance of payments and turned it from a   creditor into a debtor country. Its overseas ionvestments of more than   120 billion dollars, once a key source of income, have also been   sapped.   \"The decline in Gulf oil revenues is not a temporary phenomenon,\" Gulf   Cooperation Council (GCC) assistant secretary general for economic   affairs, Abdullah al-Quwaiz, said in press remarks this week. \"It is   due to significant changes in the oil market and the drop in their   overseas reserves.\"   Saudi Arabia, which controls a quarter of the world\\'s oil reserves,   earned in early the 1980s as much as twice as its current income of   around 45 billion dollars and expenditure was running at an average 70   billion dollars a year.   Although the infrastructure was nearly completed, the kingdom needed to   keep spending at relatively high levels to meet the needs of the   growing population.   Official figures showed such a growth was one of the fastest in the   world, with the population soaring from around 9.3 million in 1980 to   12.8 million in 1985, 14.8 million in 1988 and around 17 million in   1993.   For the first time in Saud Arabia\\'s history as an oil producer,   officials this week spoke of sacrifices, a new word in the economic   lexicon of the super-rich nation.   \"The citizens have been accusomted to enjoying high wages and living   standards,\" the Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency said in its annual report.   \"But the circumstances arising from the decline in oil prices and the   Gulf war burden, in addition to an increase in demand for services due   to a population growth, are creating new expenditure and burdens on the   national economy which require further efforts to tolerate the   sacrifices of accommodating ourselves to the new conditions.\"',\n",
